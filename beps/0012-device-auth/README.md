## Summary

<!--
The summary of the BEP is a few paragraphs long and give a high-level overview of the features to be implemented. It should be possible to read *only* the summary and understand what the BEP is proposing to accomplish and what impact it has for users.
-->

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this BEP. Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users.
-->

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the BEP. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this BEP? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation.
-->

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs or even code snippets.
If there's any ambiguity about HOW your proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

## Release Plan

<!--
This section should describe the rollout process for any new features. It must take our version policies into account and plan for a phased rollout if this change affects any existing stable APIs.

If there is any particular feedback to be gathered during the rollout, this should be described here as well.
-->

## Dependencies

<!--
List any dependencies that this work has on other BEPs or features.
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->
