# search-backend

This plugin is part of a suite of plugins that comprise the Backstage search
platform, which is still very much under development. This plugin specifically
is responsible for exposing a JSON API for querying a search engine

Documentation on how to develop and improve the search platform is currently
centralized in the `search` plugin README.md.

For a better overview of how the search platform is put together, check the
[Backstage Search Architecture](https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/architecture)
documentation.
