# @backstage/plugin-catalog-unprocessed-entities-common

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 924c1ac: **BREAKING**- the `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-unprocessed` constructor is now private, and have been moved to using the static `.create` method instead which now requires a `PermissionService` and `DiscoveryService`.

  If you're using this module in the old backend system you'll need to migrate to using the `.create` method and pass in the new required parameters in `packages/backend/src/plugins/catalog.ts`.

  No changes should be required if you're using the new backend system.

  ```diff
  -  const unprocessed = new UnprocessedEntitiesModule(
  -    await env.database.getClient(),
  -    router,
  -  );
  + const unprocessed = UnprocessedEntitiesModule.create({
  +    database: await env.database.getClient(),
  +    router,
  +    permissions: env.permissions,
  +    discovery: env.discovery,
  +  });

    unprocessed.registerRoutes();
  ```

  Adds the ability to delete an unprocessed entity from the `refresh_state` table. This change requires enabling permissions for your Backstage instance.
