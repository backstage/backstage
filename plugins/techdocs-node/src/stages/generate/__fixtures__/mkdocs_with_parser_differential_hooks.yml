# This file intentionally uses duplicate merge keys (<<) which is technically
# invalid YAML, but is accepted by most parsers with different behaviors:
# - js-yaml: uses the first merge key value (hooks: null)
# - PyYAML: uses the last merge key value (hooks: [custom_hook.py])
# This tests that sanitization catches hooks regardless of parser interpretation.
