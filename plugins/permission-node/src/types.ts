 * Rules can either be evaluated against a resource loaded in memory, or used as filters when
 * loading a collection of resources from a data source. The `apply` and `toQuery` methods implement
 * these two concepts.
 *
 * The two operations should always have the same logical result. If they donâ€™t, the effective
 * outcome of an authorization operation will sometimes differ depending on how the authorization
 * check was performed.
