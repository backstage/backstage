/**
 * Creates a condition factory function for a given authorization rule and parameter types.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * For example, an isEntityOwner rule for catalog entities might take an array of entityRef strings.
 * The rule itself defines _how_ to check a given resource, whereas a condition also includes _what_
 * to verify.
 *
 * Plugin authors should generally use the {@link createConditionExports} in order to efficiently
 * create multiple condition factories. This helper should generally only be used to construct
 * condition factories for third-party rules that aren't part of the backend plugin with which
 * they're intended to integrate.
