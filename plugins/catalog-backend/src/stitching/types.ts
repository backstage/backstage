 * @remarks
 *
 * In immediate mode, stitching happens "in-band" (blocking) immediately when
 * each processing task finishes. When set to `'deferred'`, stitching is instead
 * deferred to happen on a separate asynchronous worker queue just like
 * processing.
 *
 * Deferred stitching should make performance smoother when ingesting large
 * amounts of entities, and reduce p99 processing times and repeated
 * over-stitching of hot spot entities when fan-out/fan-in in terms of relations
 * is very large. It does however also come with some performance cost due to
 * the queuing with how much wall-clock time some types of task take.
