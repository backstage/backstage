    description: `Register entities defined remotely (create new Locations).

This tool is analogous to the "register existing components" function you see in the Backstage dashboard,
where you supply a URL link that allows for the downloading of a 'catalog-info.yaml' file that 
defines the various Entities (Components, Systems, Resources, APIs, Users, and Groups) you want to 
create or import into the Backstage catalog.

The action within the catalog results in the creation of a Location entity that is the parent of owner
of all the additional entities defined in the 'catalog-info.yaml' file.

The dynamically generated, random UUID created to go along with the newly created Location entity is returned
to the caller.  That UUID can be later used if you want to unregister or delete the Location entity and all
of its children entities.

If an error occurred during processing, the 'locationID' field will be blank, and the 'error' field will contain
a message describing the error.

Example invocation and the output from the invocation:
  # Register a Location from a GitHub URL
  register-catalog-entities locationURL: https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/model-catalog-example/blob/main/developer-model-service/catalog-info.yaml
  Output: {
    "locationID": "aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd"
  }      
`,
