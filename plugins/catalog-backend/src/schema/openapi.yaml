            A display name of the entity, to be presented in user interfaces instead
            of the `name` property above, when available.
            This field is sometimes useful when the `name` is cumbersome or ends up
            being perceived as overly technical. The title generally does not have
            as stringent format requirements on it, so it may contain special
            characters and be more explanatory. Do keep it very short though, and
            avoid situations where a title can be confused with the name of another
            entity, or where two entities share a title.
            Note that this is only for display purposes, and may be ignored by some
            parts of the code. Entity references still always make use of the `name`
            property, not the title.

            identifier of the entity, and as such it will appear in URLs, database
            tables, entity references, and similar. It is subject to restrictions
            regarding what characters are allowed.

        This is some form of representation of what the analyzer could deduce.
        We should probably have a chat about how this can best be conveyed to
        the frontend. It'll probably contain a (possibly incomplete) entity, plus
        enough info for the frontend to know what form data to show to the user
        for overriding/completing the info.
