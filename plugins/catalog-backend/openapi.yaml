                This field is sometimes useful when the `name` is cumbersome or ends up
                being perceived as overly technical. The title generally does not have
                as stringent format requirements on it, so it may contain special
                characters and be more explanatory. Do keep it very short though, and
                avoid situations where a title can be confused with the name of another
                entity, or where two entities share a title.
                Note that this is only for display purposes, and may be ignored by some
                parts of the code. Entity references still always make use of the `name`
