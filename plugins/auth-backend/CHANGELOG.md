- 6d29605db: Change the default backend plugin mount point to /api
- 5249594c5: Add service discovery interface and implement for single host deployments

  Fixes #1847, #2596

  Went with an interface similar to the frontend DiscoveryApi, since it's dead simple but still provides a lot of flexibility in the implementation.

  Also ended up with two different methods, one for internal endpoint discovery and one for external. The two use-cases are explained a bit more in the docs, but basically it's service-to-service vs callback URLs.

  This did get me thinking about uniqueness and that we're heading towards a global namespace for backend plugin IDs. That's probably fine, but if we're happy with that we should leverage it a bit more to simplify the backend setup. For example we'd have each plugin provide its own ID and not manually mount on paths in the backend.

  Draft until we're happy with the implementation, then I can add more docs and changelog entry. Also didn't go on a thorough hunt for places where discovery can be used, but I don't think there are many since it's been pretty awkward to do service-to-service communication.

- 6f1768c0f: Initial implementation of catalog user lookup

  This adds a basic catalog client + method for the Google provider to look up users in the catalog. It expects to find a single user entity in the catalog with a google.com/email annotation that matches the email of the Google profile.

  Right now it falls back to the old behavior of splitting the email, since I don't wanna break the sign-in flow for existing apps, not yet anyway x).

  - Added "@backstage/catalog-model@^0.1.1-alpha.23" as a dependency
  - Added "node-fetch@^2.6.1" as a dependency
