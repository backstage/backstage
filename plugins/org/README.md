### MyGroupsSidebarItem

The MyGroupsSidebarItem provides quick access to the group(s) the logged in user is a member of directly in the sidebar.

To use the MyGroupsSidebarItem you'll need to add it to your `Root.tsx` - found at `packages\app\src\components\Root` - like this:

```diff
+ import { MyGroupsSidebarItem } from '@backstage/plugin-org';
+ import GroupIcon from '@material-ui/icons/People';

<SidebarPage>
    <Sidebar>
      //...
      <SidebarGroup label="Menu" icon={<MenuIcon />}>
        {/* Global nav, not org-specific */}
        //...
        <SidebarItem icon={HomeIcon} to="catalog" text="Home" />
+       <MyGroupsSidebarItem
+         singularTitle="My Squad"
+         pluralTitle="My Squads"
+         icon={GroupIcon}
+       />
       //...
      </SidebarGroup>
    </ Sidebar>
</SidebarPage>
```

Once added MyGroupsSidebarItem will work in three ways:

1. The user is not logged in or the logged in user is not a member of any group: the MyGroupsSidebarItem will not display anything in the sidebar
2. The user is logged in and a member of only one group: the MyGroupsSidebarItem will display a single item in the sidebar like this:

   ![MyGroupsSidebarItem single example](./docs/mygroupssidebaritem-single.png)

3. The user is logged in and a member of more than one group: the MyGroupsSidebarItem will display a single items with a sub-menu with all the related groups like this:

   ![MyGroupsSidebarItem multiple example](./docs/mygroupssidebaritem-multiple.png)
