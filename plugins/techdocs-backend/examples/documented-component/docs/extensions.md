# Plugins & Extensions

Just by including the TechDocs Core Plugin to your MkDocs site included with Backstage,
you gain the immediate use of a variety of popular plugins and extensions to MkDocs.

For more information and full details of the available features, see the
[`mkdocs-techdocs-core` repository](https://github.com/backstage/mkdocs-techdocs-core#mkdocs-plugins-and-extensions).

This page provides a demonstration of some of the available features.

## Admonitions

Admonitions are call outs that help catch a users attention.

To define an admonition simply put the following Markdown into your content:

```
!!! warn
    Defining admonitions can be addicting.
```

And they end up looking like this:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
