# Inner Component Docs

This is a basic example of documentation within a larger suite of TechDocs that can be referenced by whatever entities necessary. It is intended as a showcase of the `backstage.io/techdocs-entity-path` annotation for linking to a "subpage" in TechDocs that are declared by another entity.

Please review the [How-To Guides - Deep Linking Into TechDocs](../../../../../../docs/features/techdocs/how-to-guides.md#deep-linking-into-techdocs) section for more information and you can view the example usage on the "Example Entity Documented By TechDocs Entity Annotation" component in this [catalog-info.yaml](../../catalog-info.yaml) file.
