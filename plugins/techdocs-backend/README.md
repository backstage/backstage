# techdocs-backend

This is the backend part of the techdocs plugin.

## Getting Started

This backend plugin can be started in a standalone mode directly from in this package
using `yarn start`. However, it will have limited functionality and that process is
most convenient when developing the techdocs backend plugin itself.

To evaluate TechDocs and have a greater amount of functionality available, instead do:

```bash
# From your Backstage root directory
cd packages/backend
yarn start
```

## What techdocs-backend does

This provides serving and building of documentation for any entity.
To configure various storage providers and building options, see http://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/configuration.

The techdocs-backend re-exports the [techdocs-node](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/techdocs-node) package which has the features to prepare, generate and publish docs.
The Publishers are also used to fetch the static documentation files and render them in TechDocs.
