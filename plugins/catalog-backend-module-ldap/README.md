# Catalog Backend Module for LDAP

This is an extension module to the plugin-catalog-backend plugin, providing an LdapOrgReaderProcessor that can be
used to ingest organization data from an LDAP server. This processor is useful if you want to import users and
groups from your Active Directory or another LDAP compatible server.

## Getting started

See [Backstage documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/ldap/org) for details on how to install
and configure the plugin.

## Legacy backend

You can find the legacy documentation at `docs/integrations/ldap/org--old.md`.
