# not-found

Welcome to the not-found (a.k.a 404) plugin!

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

**Note**
Due to _react-router_ configurations, where the \* always matches, please ensure that this plugin is the **last** registered route

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/\*](http://localhost:3000/*).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
