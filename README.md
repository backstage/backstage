_During the month of July the majority of the maintainers will be on summer vacation 🏖️ Development will continue as usual, but expect a slower pace for discussions and PR reviews. Why not take this opportunity to [build a plugin](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/)?_

## What is Backstage?

[Backstage](https://backstage.io/) is an open platform for building developer portals. Powered by a centralized software catalog, Backstage restores order to your microservices and infrastructure and enables your product teams to ship high-quality code quickly — without compromising autonomy.

Backstage unifies all your infrastructure tooling, services, and documentation to create a streamlined development environment from end to end.

![software-catalog](https://backstage.io/blog/assets/6/header.png)

Out of the box, Backstage includes:

- [Backstage Software Catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/software-catalog-overview) for managing all your software (microservices, libraries, data pipelines, websites, ML models, etc.)
- [Backstage Software Templates](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/software-templates-index) for quickly spinning up new projects and standardizing your tooling with your organization’s best practices
- [Backstage TechDocs](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/techdocs-overview) for making it easy to create, maintain, find, and use technical documentation, using a "docs like code" approach
- Plus, a growing ecosystem of [open source plugins](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins) that further expand Backstage’s customizability and functionality

Backstage was created by Spotify but is now hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io) as a Sandbox level project. Read the announcement [here](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/09/23/backstage-cncf-sandbox).
