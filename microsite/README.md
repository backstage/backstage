# Backstage Documentation

This folder holds the service and configuration that runs Backstage's documentation hosted at https://backstage.io.

It pulls content in from the [root `/docs`](../docs/) folder and builds it into the resulting HTML web site.

This website was created with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

# Getting Started

Testing the web site locally is a great way to see what final website will look like after publishing, and is ideal for testing more complex changes, large updates to navigation, or complex page designs that may include special alignment, which may not otherwise be validated through continuous integration.

## Installation

```
$ yarn install
```

## Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most content changes made to the `docs/` root folder are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory, which is what will be deployed to GitHub pages from the master branch.

## Directory Structure

Your project file structure should look something like this

```
my-docusaurus/
  docs/
    doc-1.md
    doc-2.md
    doc-3.md
  website/

## Adding Content

### Adding a new docs page to an existing sidebar

1. Create the doc as a new markdown file in `/docs`, example `docs/newly-created-doc.md`:

```md
---
id: newly-created-doc
title: This Doc Needs To Be Edited
---

My new content here..
```

1. Refer to that doc's ID in an existing sidebar in `website/sidebars.json`:

```javascript
// Add newly-created-doc to the Getting Started category of docs
{
  "docs": {
    "Getting Started": [
      "quick-start",
      "newly-created-doc" // new doc here
    ],
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

### Adding a new blog post

1. Make sure there is a header link to your blog in `website/siteConfig.js`:

`website/siteConfig.js`

```javascript
headerLinks: [
    ...
    { blog: true, label: 'Blog' },
    ...
]
```

2. Create the blog post with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-My-Blog-Post-Title.md` in `website/blog`:

`website/blog/2018-05-21-New-Blog-Post.md`

```markdown
---
author: Frank Li
authorURL: https://twitter.com/foobarbaz
authorFBID: 503283835

---

Lorem Ipsum...
```

### Adding items to your site's top navigation bar

1. Add links to docs, custom pages or external links by editing the headerLinks field of `website/siteConfig.js`:

`website/siteConfig.js`

```javascript
{
  headerLinks: [
    ...
    /* you can add docs */
    { doc: 'my-examples', label: 'Examples' },
    /* you can add custom pages */
    { page: 'help', label: 'Help' },
    /* you can add external links */
    { href: 'https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus', label: 'GitHub' },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

For more information about the navigation bar, click [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/navigation)

### Adding custom pages

1. Docusaurus uses React components to build pages. The components are saved as .js files in `website/pages/en`:
1. If you want your page to show up in your navigation header, you will need to update `website/siteConfig.js` to add to the `headerLinks` element:

`website/siteConfig.js`

```javascript
{
  headerLinks: [
    ...
    { page: 'my-new-custom-page', label: 'My New Custom Page' },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Additional notes

- If you want to make images zoomable on click, add the `data-zoomable` attribute to your `img` element.
  - In a docs or blog `.md` file, convert `![This is image](/microsite/static/img/code.png)` syntax to `<img data-zoomable src="/microsite/static/img/code.png" alt="This is image" />`
