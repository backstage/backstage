            Documentation! Everyone needs it, no one wants to create it, and no
            one can ever find it. Backstage follows a “docs like code” approach:
            you write documentation in Markdown files right alongside your code.
            This makes documentation easier to create, maintain, find — and, you
            know, actually use. This demo video showcases Spotify’s internal
            version of TechDocs. Learn more about{' '}
