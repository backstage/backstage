But if you couldn't make it, then settle in, prepare a spot of tea, and read on for highlights. Then head over to the Backstage Community's YouTube channel to [catch up on all the great Backstage talks][playlist] you missed.

If that riddle of a title doesn't pull you in, I'm not sure what else to say! This panel ‚Äî featuring Scott Guymer (Philips), Remi Higuchi & Tina Vincent (H&M Group), Jan Magnusson (IKEA), and Martin W√§nersk√§r (Volvo Cars) ‚Äî brings a diverse group of Backstage adopters together. It's well worth hearing their different impact and success stories, and comparing their perspectives on the business case for developer portals.

With all the various AI tools out there, it's becoming hard to keep track of them all. But with the Catalog in Backstage, this becomes much easier. John Collier from Red Hat walks through how they approached this problem space internally as their inventory of AI tools ‚Äî inference servers, models, and API gateways ‚Äî grew and grew.

### #4: [Exemplar-y Backstage Templates][4]

![Brent Swish from ITHAKA presents at BackstageCon Europe 2025](assets/2025-04-29/kc25london-ithaka.png)

The heart of offering your platform in a self-service way is to use Software Templates. What if you could make the templates themselves easier to update and contribute to? Brent Swisher from educational nonprofit ITHAKA walks through how they came up with a technique called ‚Äúexemplar‚Äù templates to speed up the process of creating and updating templates, making them more accessible to other devs and easier to maintain.

This talk by Chris Heisz and Luke Beamish from graph technology specialists, Neo4j, is a great showcase of how you can use the Scaffolder along with Argo Workflows to offer self-service integration and chaos testing. See how they ensure thousands of Kubernetes clusters are stable and performant. (You'll be OK, little guy!)
