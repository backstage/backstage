Wow, London sure didn't hold back! [Five years][birthday] after the open source framework was released, Backstage was clearly on people's minds — from those new to internal developer portals to those who have been contributing since the earliest days. Conversations about Backstage spanned from BackstageCon to the rest of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe, which had a record-setting attendance of nearly 13,000 people. But if you couldn't make it, then settle in, prepare a spot of tea, and read on for highlights. Then head over to the Backstage Community's YouTube channel to [catch up on all the great Backstage talks][playlist] you missed.

Kicking the week off was the fifth-ever BackstageCon — a full day of talks featuring voices and perspectives from across the community. Here are just a few of the highlights from the day.

### #1: [Unlocking Backstage's Potential: Driving Adoption and Maturity With Your Developer Community][1]

If that riddle of a title doesn't pull you in, I'm not sure what else to say! This panel — featuring Scott Guymer (Philips), Remi Higuchi & Tina Vincent (H&M Group), Jan Magnusson (IKEA), and Martin Wänerskär (Volvo Cars) — brings a diverse group of Backstage adopters together. It's well worth hearing their different impact and success stories, and comparing their perspectives on the business case for developer portals.

### #3: [Lightning Talk: We Built a Unified AI Asset Catalog in Backstage][3]

With all the various AI tools out there, it's becoming hard to keep track of them all. But with the Catalog in Backstage, this becomes much easier. John Collier from Red Hat walks through how they approached this problem space internally as their inventory of AI tools — inference servers, models, and API gateways — grew and grew.

### #4: [Exemplar-y Backstage Templates][4]

![Brent Swish from ITHAKA presents at BackstageCon Europe 2025](assets/2025-04-29/kc25london-ithaka.png)

The heart of offering your platform in a self-service way is to use Software Templates. What if you could make the templates themselves easier to update and contribute to? Brent Swisher from educational nonprofit ITHAKA walks through how they came up with a technique called “exemplar” templates to speed up the process of creating and updating templates, making them more accessible to other devs and easier to maintain.

### #5: [From Click To Chaos: Linking Argo Workflows and Backstage for Automated Testing][5]

![Chris Heisz and Luke Beamish from Neo4j presents at BackstageCon Europe 2025](assets/2025-04-29/kc25london-neo4j.png)

This talk by Chris Heisz and Luke Beamish from graph technology specialists, Neo4j, is a great showcase of how you can use the Scaffolder along with Argo Workflows to offer self-service integration and chaos testing. See how they ensure thousands of Kubernetes clusters are stable and performant. (You'll be OK, little guy!)

_(Hey, that's me! Thanks for all the great pics, 📸 [CNCF][flickr])_

After a successful appearance last year in [Salt Lake City][slc], Backstage ContribFest made its European debut. The community came out — with laptops in tow — for this session all about contributing to Backstage and the Community Plugins. Excited first-timers got to sit down with experienced contributors as well as core maintainers to work through a list of issues or to build plugins together. Keep your eyes on the release notes — some of those features might just have started here!

What a jam-packed conference week! As I was walking out of the Excel London conference center, I swear I spotted Bowie in a low-riding, candy-red Cadillac saying something about needing to see [his cousins and his mama, too][spotify]? Guess we'll find out [in Atlanta this November][na]!
