My friends, what an intense conference!

Over the course of three packed days, there were a bunch of activities, including talks, a kiosk, and a Contribfest, all centered around Backstage.

### Maintainers take the stage

![Backstage maintainers presenting in a ballroom](assets/2024-12-09/kc24slc-spotify-maintainers.jpg)

This may be old hat for those who are regular KubeCon attendees, but it‚Äôs still pretty exciting to catch up on all the Backstage updates straight from the core maintainers. Spotify‚Äôs Ben Lambert and Patrik Oldsberg were in the spotlight in Ballroom C addressing an attentive crowd of Backstage adopters, users, and fans.

Highlights of their maintainers talk include:

- **Project updates:** Yarn 4 is now the default, the new built-in event bus has arrived, and the (New) Backend System is now 1.0!
- **Security Audit:** Another security audit has been completed with the helpful support of the CNCF
- **Scaffolder updates:** Addition of Form Decorators and support for Retries!
- **New Frontend System:** Focus on the plugin builder experience!

Adobe gave a shoutout to Backstage from the Keynote mainstage on Thursday morning when they (spoiler alert) [accepted the CNCF‚Äôs Top End User Award][keynote], thanking the cloud native community and all the projects that they use.

But Adobe isn‚Äôt just a Backstage adopter, they are a model citizen ‚Äî giving back to the community through their example, having ‚Äúdeveloped a reference architecture for its IDP, built using Argo, Backstage, Helm, and Kubernetes, which other organizations can use as a template for designing and implementing their systems‚Äù.

As Taylor Dolezal, head of ecosystem at the CNCF, [says][announcement]: ‚ÄúTheir commitment to nurturing technological excellence and developer experience exemplifies what we hope to see in the end user ecosystem. It‚Äôs not just about tool adoption or code contributions ‚Äî it‚Äôs about synthesizing these learnings into assets that empower others in their cloud native journeys.‚Äù

Way to go, Adobe!

### A bustling CNCF project pavilion

The CNCF Projects Pavilion was buzzing with activity all week, and the Backstage kiosk was a hub of excitement. Attendees stopped by with a mix of curiosity and enthusiasm, sparking conversations that highlighted the dynamic nature of our community.

Curious visitors asked, ‚ÄúWhat is Backstage all about?‚Äù, while adopters sought personalized advice on customizing Backstage for their specific company needs. Contributors dropped in to say, ‚ÄúHey, you reviewed my pull request!‚Äù And professionals proudly shared their achievements as Backstage experts ‚Äî in fact, now there‚Äôs a way to make that expertise official ‚Äî by becoming a [Certified Backstage Associate (CBA)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/blog/just-launched-certified-backstage-associate-cba/), a new certification that was just launched by the CNCF and The Linux Foundation.

Developers eager to give back to the community came to learn how to start contributing, and some of the kindest Backstage fans simply stopped by to say, ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù. Their gratitude and encouragement are a powerful reminder of why we do what we do.

Every interaction in person made the day special, and we wrapped up with a deep sense of fulfillment and pride in how far Backstage has come. Here's to building an even brighter future together!

It was a great example of a community coming together to support learning and contribution.

The energy in the room, with 60 enthusiastic participants, was absolutely electric! It was amazing to see ideas bouncing around, impromptu collaboration happening at every corner, and a shared passion for advancing the Backstage project.

Among the great contributions to come out of this event are:
