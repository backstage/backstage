        This template helps you propose new features, enhancements, or other ideas for Backstage. You can keep your proposal lightweight, but please provide enough detail for reviewers to understand and respond effectively.

        For complex additions, consider creating a [Backstage Enhancement Proposal](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/beps/README.md) (BEP) instead, as this process streamlines discussions and iteration. Don't worry - you can always convert this issue to a BEP later.
