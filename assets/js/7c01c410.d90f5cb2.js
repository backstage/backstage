It requires a comprehensive understanding of every facet of a service, including process metrics like DORA, as well as clear ownership of services and processes. By implementing Elevate as an internal developer portal, development teams now have better visibility of ownership in the distributed systems they work in. They also have the benefit of consolidated application health data and other metrics gained from the SaaS products they utilize everyday. This approach ensures a \u201Csingle pane of glass\u201D for application ownership and health so our teams can focus on building products and features that help our customers invest for a prosperous future."]})]})}function h(e={}){let{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,r.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,r.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},253836(e,t,a){a.d(t,{A:()=>s});let s=a.p+"assets/images/banner-3aedcaa1bd84c0d0e2fa33535f2fc651.png"},28453(e,t,a){a.d(t,{R:()=>n,x:()=>i});var s=a(296540);let r={},o=s.createContext(r);function n(e){let t=s.useContext(o);return s.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}},[t,e])}function i(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(r):e.components||r:n(e.components),s.createElement(o.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}},522691(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/08/stash-adopter-post","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-08-stash-adopter-post.mdx","title":"Adopter Spotlight: How Stash simplified monitoring, ownership and true app health with microservices","description":"backstage header","date":"2023-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":13.44,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Taylor Webber, Staff Engineer, Stash","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Adopter Spotlight: How Stash simplified monitoring, ownership and true app health with microservices","author":"Taylor Webber, Staff Engineer, Stash"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Five common traits of successful Backstage adopters","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/28/frontside-adopter-post"},"nextItem":{"title":"Switching out the Software Templates Sandbox","permalink":"/blog/2023/06/21/switching-out-sandbox"}}')}}]);
