In Atlanta, we co-hosted our third [Backstage Contribfest](https://backstage.io/blog/2025/10/15/backstage-contribfest-kubecon-guide) with participants of all experience and skill levels diving into the Backstage repos to tackle issues together \u2014 and with plenty of Backstage maintainers and contributors close at hand to help out.\\n\\nA few ContribFest-fueled pull requests have already popped up in the repos:\\n\\n- fix(ui): render html in gfm mode in MarkdownContent component ([#31770](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/31770))\\n- catalog-react: OwnerEntityPicker case insensitive ([#31756](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/31756))\\n- fix: making the github urls case insensitive ([#31754](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/31754))\\n- fix: success announcements should be transient ([#6041](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/pull/6041) \u2014 \u2705 merged!)\\n\\nMany thanks to all the participants and to our fellow hosts \u2014 Kurt King from Procore and Aramis Sennyey from DoorDash!\u{1F64F}\\n\\n\u{1F6E0}\uFE0F If you haven\'t yet joined our worldwide community of contributors, [there\'s no time like the present](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!\\n\\n## Maintainers talk: Stable foundations, MCP innovations\\n\\n![Backstage Maintainers Track at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2025!](assets/2025-11-25/kcon25-atl-maintainers.gif)\\n\\nAs always, the main event for the community is the Maintainers Track session. Backstage core maintainers Ben Lambert and Patrik Oldsberg closed out the week celebrating a year of milestones \u2014 including contributions big and small from the community \u2014 while looking ahead to what\'s next for the framework.\\n\\nIn their talk, [Backstage Celebrations: Stable Foundations and MCP Innovations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evmmr-uxNsc&list=PL8iP9yIjU0Q33vpSaBlAvIhgDb-9smXUU), they shared:\\n\\n- **Project Updates:** Adopters, plugins, and stars \u2014 and all the other ways the Backstage community continues to grow, including in the community-plugins repo. Plus, improvements to issue handling and more.\\n\\n- **Project Maturity:** With the new backend ([released as a stable 1.0 last year](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.31.0/)) and new frontend ([adoption-ready as of this year](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.42.0)) now both in place, the Backstage framework has modern foundations built for the future.

Then read on to get yourself prepared for the session beforehand to maximize your time working with other contributors and Backstage experts during the session.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Contrib-what?\\n\\nBefore we dive into preparation for the Backstage ContribFest session we should probably take a detour and answer the question: What the heck is ContribFest?\\n\\nContribFest is a track at KubeCon where various CNCF projects will host hands-on sessions working with their respective communities on contributions towards their projects. You don\'t have to be a past contributor to participate \u2014 new community members are encouraged to join!\\n\\nThese sessions are 75 minutes long and take place in a room with roughly a dozen circular tables that seat about eight people making it easy to work and collaborate. They usually lead off with some getting started steps and then give attendees the rest of the time to work on their contributions with the aid of experts from the project.\\n\\n## What to prepare before you get there\\n\\nFor the Backstage ContribFest session, there are some preparation steps you can complete on your own well before the session. Let\'s cover those now:\\n\\n### 1. Fork the repos\\n\\nYou\'ll have the option to contribute to the Backstage repo or the Backstage Community Plugins repo. To get those onto your system, you need to follow the GitHub [\\"Forking a repository\\"](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) guide and fork these:\\n\\n- Backstage: [https://github.com/backstage/backstage](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)\\n- Backstage Community Plugins: [https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins)\\n\\n### 2. Update Node.js and Yarn\\n\\nBackstage has [a few prerequisites](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites) that you\'ll need to have in place before you can run Backstage or the various Backstage Community Plugins. Here\'s what you need:\\n\\n- Backstage uses Node.js \u2014 you\'ll want to install version 22 for the session.\\n  - To make this easier, we recommend you use Node Version Manager nvm, you can [follow these instructions to install it](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script).\\n  - Once you have nvm installed, you can run this command to get Node 22 installed and activated: `nvm install 22`\\n- Yarn is the package manager used by Backstage \u2014 you\'ll want to install it as well.\\n\\n  - Simply run `corepack enable` to do so.\\n\\n### 3. Test your setups\\n\\nNow let\'s do a quick test to confirm that everything is working.\\n\\nFirst, let\'s check that you can run the Backstage codebase:\\n\\n1. Navigate to your cloned fork of the Backstage repo\\n2. From the root, run `yarn install`\\n3. Then run `yarn tsc`\\n4. Finally run `yarn start`\\n5. Backstage will open in a new browser window or tab\\n\\nNow, let\'s check the Backstage Community Plugins:\\n\\n1. Navigate to your your cloned fork of the Backstage Community Plugins repo\\n2. This repo is structured in a way where there are many plugins that live in their own dedicated workspace \u2014 for this test, we\'ll use the `linguist` workspace. From the root, run `cd workspaces/linguist`\\n3. From here run `yarn install`\\n4. Then run `yarn tsc`\\n5. Finally run `yarn start`\\n6. An example Backstage app will open in a new browser window or tab\\n\\n### Bonus: Check out the contribution guides\\n\\nAt this point, you have all the prerequisites in place and are ready to take part in the Backstage ContribFest session. From here, we recommend you take some time to read the contributions guides as that will get you more familiar with the overall process.

While these tools served their purpose, there\'s a growing need for more robust service\\ncatalogues that require less maintenance and reduce over-engineered tooling. Frameworks like Backstage have emerged as powerful solutions.\\n\\nThe decision is often made to establish a single source of truth for services and engineering teams. The vision is typically for reliability or platform teams to envision a world where every software development\\nteam, regardless of size or domain, can efficiently manage projects, access tools and resources, and foster a collaborative culture. A modern developer portal aims to become the go-to platform for developers, infrastructure teams, and product managers to collaborate, accelerate development cycles, and deliver high-quality software. It serves as a centralized hub, consolidating all necessary information, tools, and services that developers require throughout the software development lifecycle.\\n\\n## Internal Services Landscape\\n\\n![internal services](assets/2025-08-08/image02.png)\\n\\nIn large organizations, it\'s common to manage thousands of GitHub repositories, encompassing a wide array of assets such as front end web applications, backend web services, mobile applications, and APIs. For instance, a typical enterprise might have:\\n\\n- Hundreds or thousands of APIs\\n- Hundreds or thousands Services\\n- Dozens of Web applications\\n- Various libraries, infrastructure components, etc.\\n\\nMigrating these internal services from various engineering teams requires a systematic approach to retrieve the existing service definitions and transform them into a format compatible with the new\\ndeveloper portal. This often involves automated scripts to ensure efficient ingestion. For example, successfully migrating hundreds of services into a new portal is a common achievement in such initiatives.\\n\\n## GitHub Requests Architecture for Migration\\n\\n**Using an Entity Provider and a Scripted Migration**\\n\\nIn our Backstage setup, we took a hybrid approach: we used an automated script to generate and submit `catalog-info.yaml` files to service repositories, and relied on the GitHub Entity Provider defined in our\\n`app-config.yaml` to ingest them into the catalog. This gave us the best of both worlds.\\n\\nThe script handled the heavy lifting of migrating metadata from for example legacy `(.appcatalog.yaml)` files, transforming them into the modern format expected by Backstage. It also empowered teams by\\nsubmitting pull requests they could review and enrich adding ownership metadata, documentation links, or system context before merging. Once merged, the GitHub Entity Provider took over, ingesting the files on a\\nscheduled basis and ensuring Backstage stayed up to date. This pattern reduced manual overhead, maintained decentralization, and eliminated the need for a persistent integration with the legacy system. Since the old catalog was being decommissioned, this also aligned with our goal of moving forward cleanly without syncing two sources of truth.\\n\\n![api orchestration](assets/2025-08-08/image03.png)\\n\\nSeveral technical steps are typically involved in retrieving existing service definition files `(e.g., appcatalog.yaml)`, an example yaml file, and then converting them into the modern developer portal\\\\\'s preferred\\nformat `(e.g.catalog-info.yaml` for Backstage). Rather than manually creating new definition files, an automated Python script can be developed to generate and add them to the respective repositories or services. Without creating and using these automated scripts, doing these tasks manually can take several hours and could become extremely tedious. For example, in the case of Backstage, it would mean having to explicitly create the `catalog-info.yaml` hundreds of times in hundreds of repositories which can also result in hundreds of errors and manual lift.\\n\\n**Requirement One: GitHub Apps**\\n\\nA dedicated GitHub App can be utilized to extend functionality, granting the necessary permissions to submit pull requests across multiple repositories. GitHub Apps are integrations that extend GitHub\'s functionality and can automate tasks, interacting with and extending GitHub\'s features.\\n\\nA private key `(.pem)` is retrieved for the GitHub App, and a JSON Web Token (JWT) is created. These two keys are combined to generate an Authentication Token, which is an encoded JSON Web Token.\\n\\n**Requirement Two: An Access Token and Bearer Token**\\n\\nThe Authentication Token (encoded JWT) is used to make a `GET` request to the GitHub API endpoint `/app/installations` at `api.github.com.` This request retrieves an access token URL. Once that access token URL is received, another request is made to this URL to obtain the Bearer token. This Bearer token is then used for major requests to GitHub API endpoints, such as `https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}.`\\n\\n**Base64 and YAML Processing**\\n\\nWith the Bearer token, a request can be made to retrieve the contents of GitHub repositories containing the legacy service definition files `(e.g. .appcatalog.yaml)`. GitHub typically returns these contents in\\nBase64 format, a binary-to-text encoding scheme that converts binary data into an ASCII string, often used for secure data transmission over HTTP.\\n\\nUpon receiving the encoded Base64 content, it must be decoded to YAML. The decoded YAML is then compared to the desired key-value pairings for the new catalog-info.yaml file. This is where a custom Mapper comes into\\nplay. A template for catalog-info.yaml is created following the developer portal\\\\\'s guidelines. The key-value pairs from this template are then mapped to the values received from the legacy service\\ndefinition file. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nresults[\'metadata\'][\'title\'] = data[\'appInfo\'][\'appName\']\\n# In the new format: metadata.title\\n# From the legacy file: appInfo.appName\\n```\\n\\nAfter the comparisons and correct mapping for the new format, the data is dumped into the `catalog-info.yaml` file and finally encoded back to Base64 for submission to the GitHub repository.\\n\\nAn example excerpt code of encoding YAML file to base64\\n\\n```python\\ndef encode_to_base64(file):\\n    catalog_info_data = load_yaml(file)\\n    print(catalog_info_data) #json\\n    catalog_yaml  = yaml.dump_all(catalog_info_data) #yaml\\n    print(\'\\\\n\')\\n    print(catalog_yaml)\\n\\n    logger({\'data\': catalog_yaml,\'method\':\'encode_to_base64\',\'level\': \'debug\'})\\n\\n    #yaml k:v (dict) to string\\n    dict_to_string = str(catalog_yaml)\\n    encoded =  base64.b64encode(bytes(dict_to_string, \'utf-8\')) # bytes\\n    print(\\"\\\\n\\")\\n    #decode to convert into to explicit string and remove b prefix in encoded\\n    enc_dec = encoded.decode(\'utf-8\')\\n    print(enc_dec)\\n    return enc_dec\\n```\\n\\n**Submitting Changes to the GitHub Repository**\\nSubmitting the file back to the GitHub repository involves a few more steps. A `GET` request is made to the Git branches endpoint, `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}`, to check if a new branch `(e.g.\\nupdate/developer-portal-opt-in)` already exists.\\n\\nIf the branch does not exist, it is created from the main or master branch, depending on which one is present in the repository, using `refs/heads/{branch_name}\\\\\'.format(\\\\*\\\\*locals()).` Finally, the pull\\nrequest with the encoded Base64 YAML is submitted to the branch using the GitHub endpoint `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls.`\\n\\n## Adoption and Impact\\n\\n![adoption challenges](assets/2025-08-08/image04.png)\\n\\nInitially, the adoption of a new developer portal can face challenges\\nfor several reasons:\\n\\n- Engineering teams may be hesitant to merge unfamiliar pull requests into their repositories or services.\\n- Some teams or engineers might lack a robust understanding of the new portal\'s purpose or value.\\n- The new tooling might not be a strictly defined, top-down mandated requirement from leadership.\\n- Access requests might still be required, even for a centralized portal.\\n- Customer adoption can be slow, sometimes requiring individual demonstrations even after widespread presentations.\\n- Some individuals might understand what the portal is but not its full capabilities or limitations.\\n\\n**Gaining Traction and Growth**\\n\\nDespite initial hurdles, a new developer portal can gain immense traction and adoption after numerous pitches to various teams. A key factor in widespread adoption often includes contributions from various engineering teams beyond the initial implementation group.\\n\\nThe transformation can primarily be driven by a concerted effort to understand team needs, strategically \\"sell\\" the platform\'s value, and address early friction points. The key to this success lies in demonstrating tangible benefits and integrating features that directly solved developer pain points.\\n\\n#### Understanding Team Needs\\n\\nDuring the discovery and initial implementation phases, it became clear what capabilities teams truly desired from a developer portal:\\n\\n- **Visibility into Ownership and Relationships:** Teams were highly interested in features like a **dependency graph** or **organizational chart**. They wanted clear visibility into service ownership and relationships between different services, enabling them to quickly identify whom to contact for specific issues or collaborations.\\n- **Service Discoverability:** Once they grasped the concept and value of having their services represented in a central catalogue, teams actively sought to have their services migrated or ingested using the scaffolder. Their motivation was clear: they wanted other engineers to easily find and understand their services within the portal.\\n\\n## Strategies for Selling the Idea\\n\\nA combined approach was crucial to effectively \\"sell\\" the developer portal idea to various teams:\\n\\n1. **Clear Roadmap:** Presenting a comprehensive roadmap that outlined the portal\'s current state and its future potential helped teams envision its long-term value.\\n2. **Engaging Presentations and RFCs:** Conducting engineering presentations to numerous teams and sharing Requests for Comments (RFCs) allowed for broader review, gathered valuable insights, and fostered a sense of community involvement.\\n3. **Highlighting Discoverability:** Emphasizing that their services would be easily discoverable by other teams and that the portal would serve as a single source of truth for all component information related to their services was a powerful selling point.\\n4. **Personalized Demos:** Conducting 1:1 Slack huddles with individual engineers to demo the platform provided a personalized experience and allowed for direct addressing of questions.\\n5. **Visual Aids:** Utilizing diagrams of various components and illustrating their benefits helped simplify complex concepts and showcase the portal\'s advantages.\\n6. **Addressing Codebase Concerns:** When submitting the automated pull requests with the migration script, it was crucial to explain to teams that these changes would not result in any loss of functionality, nor would they have any adverse effects or modifications to their existing codebase.\\n\\n### Addressing Early Friction\\n\\nDespite these efforts, initial friction was inevitable:\\n\\n1.  **Pushback on Automated PRs:** There was initial pushback regarding the automated pull requests submitted to their repositories.\\n2.  **Reluctance to Merge:** Engineering teams were hesitant to merge a \\"random\\" PR into their repositories, especially without a full understanding of its purpose.\\n3.  **Lack of Understanding:** Some teams simply didn\\\\\'t have a robust understanding of what the portal was or its value, leading them to either not merge the `catalog-info.yaml` PR or, in some cases,\\n    even delete it.\\n\\nThrough persistent engagement, clear communication, and demonstrating tangible value, these initial resistances can be gradually overcome. The strategic addition of features and the active involvement of other\\nengineering teams, particularly those focused on reliability platforms and SRE, proved instrumental in demonstrating the platform\'s utility and appeal.\\n\\n## Feature Additions Driving Adoption\\n\\n![plugin ecosystem](assets/2025-08-08/image06.png)\\n\\nThe addition of components like a [Tech Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/radar) can significantly increase engineer interest. A Tech Radar is typically implemented to help engineers and cross-functional teams understand the \\"paved road\\" technology stack, what should be used for new systems andwhat existing systems should aspire to move towards. Thoughtworks created this system and can be seen here:\\n[https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/radar)\\n\\nSome other [plugins](https://backstage.io/plugins/) that\\ncan increase widespread adoption of a developer portal:\\n\\n1.  Q/A Plugin\\n2.  Groups or teams plugins\\n3.  Kubernetes plugin\\n4.  Managing External services\\n\\nA critical component that contributes to widespread adoption is the **linter plugin**. For developers migrating services to the new developer portal, ensuring the `catalog-info.yaml.` file is correct and accurate is paramount. The linter plugin, often integrated with an external API, provides an invaluable and accurate way to validate these files, making the process of creating and maintaining them much easier and less error-prone for developers. One of the most accurate ways to implement the linter plugin is making a request to [Entity validator](https://github.com/RoadieHQ/backstage-entity-validator) to make sure it is correct.\\n\\nComplementing this, a **Scaffolder** feature also plays a vital role. The Scaffolder allows developers to generate new service or component `catalog-info.yaml` files (and often entire project structures) from\\npre-defined templates. This capability effectively eliminates the need for developers to manually create these files from scratch or worry about linting them, as the generated output is inherently compliant with the portal\'s schema.\\n\\nUltimately, such efforts can successfully ingest hundreds of services, leading to a significant number of components residing within the new developer portal.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe migration of legacy internal services to a modern developer portal like Backstage represents a significant leap forward in standardizing and streamlining developer experiences. By transitioning from an internally maintained \\"App Catalogue\\" to a centralized, community-driven \\"Developer Portal,\\" organizations can lay the groundwork for enhanced collaboration, improved resource accessibility, and accelerated development cycles. Despite initial adoption challenges, the strategic implementation of features like the Tech Radar and the linter plugin, coupled with persistent outreach and contributions from various engineering teams, proves instrumental in demonstrating the inherent value of such a platform. The successful ingestion of hundreds of services stands as a testament to the effectiveness of automated migration scripts and the dedication of the teams involved. This endeavor not only provides a robust and less over-engineered service catalogue but also fosters a culture of shared ownership and continuous improvement within the engineering organization.\\n\\n## What\'s Next\\n\\nMy involvement as a software engineer with open source tools and developer portal projects like Backstage, including implementation and service migration, has provided me valuable opportunities to contribute to their open-source documentation and repositories. This can be seen in contributions such as [Update app-custom-theme.md](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/12863) and [Update getting-started.md](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/12714), which deepen understanding of custom themes and style components.

And for experienced developers, I hope this offers a fresh perspective \u2013 a look at how a new contributor navigates a complex project, and perhaps, a reminder of our own beginnings.\\nThis journey wasn\u2019t made in a single leap, but through a series of progressive stages. I\u2019ll walk you through these stages, highlighting the key learnings and contributions along the way.\\n\\n![The Stages of my Journey](assets/2025-05-12/stages.png)\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Stage 1: Laying the foundation\\n\\n![Getting Familiar with the Backstage Tech Stack](assets/2025-05-12/tech_stack.png)\\n\\nWhen I first encountered Backstage, I wasn\u2019t deeply familiar with the tech stack it relied on \u2014 Node.js, TypeScript, and React. My only exposure previously had been through hackathons, where the focus is speed over deep understanding. Another major hurdle was Git. Up until that point, I had mainly used GitHub Desktop, rarely venturing into the command line or advanced Git concepts. Realizing that effective contribution required a deeper understanding, I dedicated a week to intensively reviewing these core technologies.\\n\\nBut that wasn\u2019t all. I wanted to see Backstage in action, to really grasp what it was all about. That\u2019s when I came across the [Spotify Learning Path for Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com/learn/). Specifically, the [\u201CStanding up Backstage\u201D](https://backstage.spotify.com/learn/standing-up-backstage/) section was incredibly useful. It walked me through setting up a local running instance with a Postgres database and GitHub authentication. From there, I explored the Backstage documentation and experimented with adding features to my local instance. Honestly, for me, this stage was all about building confidence. It was about facing my knowledge gaps head-on and taking the time to learn.\\n\\n## Stage 2: First contributions\\n\\n![First contributions to Backstage: learning the process and connecting with the community](assets/2025-05-12/first_contributions.png)\\n\\nWith my foundational skills in place, it was time to take the leap and make my first contributions to Backstage. [My first pull request](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/pull/497) (PR) was quite simple \u2014 fixing broken links in the documentation. This seemingly minor fix was my first step, and it paved the way for more substantial contributions. It helped me to get comfortable with the contributing process, learn how to submit a PR, and understand the review workflow. After that, I started looking for open issues in the [community-plugins repository](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins). I found an issue about [linking npm releases of plugins to specific Git commits](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/issues/489) \u2014 a task that pushed me outside my comfort zone once again. At the time, I knew very little about GitHub Actions and workflows. Learning on the fly, I relied heavily on guidance from maintainers who were incredibly welcoming.\\nThis experience was really helpful, not just for the task itself, but also because it introduced me to key community resources like the [Backstage Discord](https://discord.com/invite/backstage-687207715902193673) and [Special Interest Groups](https://github.com/backstage/community/tree/main/sigs) (or SIGs for short). While the content of the pull requests in this stage was certainly useful, the real value came from learning the project\u2019s workflows and community processes.\\n\\n## Stage 3: Making substantial contributions\\n\\nAs my confidence grew, so did the complexity of the contributions that I took on. Two of my first feature-related contributions were related to Catalog Permissions and the LDAP Processor.\\nFirst, with Catalog Permissions, I noticed that two endpoints in the Catalog plugin, `/analyze-location` and `/validate-entity` weren\u2019t restricted by permissions, posing a security risk. To address this, I needed a deep understanding of Backstage\u2019s permissions system. I spent a lot of time reading through documentation and existing code, and asking questions on Discord. When I had [a PR](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/25924) ready, I went to the Framework SIG meetings to discuss my implementation and to make sure that I was on the same page as the maintainers. Following this process, my PR was successfully merged!\\nShortly after, I tackled an open issue with the [LDAP processor](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/26225). This issue highlighted a problem where Backstage couldn\u2019t correctly map user-group relationships with certain LDAP server configurations that used attribute names that were different from the ones hardcoded within the plugin. I implemented [a solution](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/26511) that allowed users to override these default values. Testing against a real LDAP instance wasn\u2019t something I could do locally, but the original issue reporter stepped in, validating my changes in their environment. It was a beautiful example of open source collaboration in action.\\n\\n![My first commits in the backstage CHANGELOG](assets/2025-05-12/changelog.png)\\n_My first commits in the backstage CHANGELOG_\\n\\nThese two tasks were a significant step up from my initial contributions. They required a deeper understanding of Backstage\u2019s architecture and a greater level of problem-solving. Seeing my commits in the [CHANGELOG](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.31.0/#new-catalog-permissions) was an accomplishment I was proud of, and it solidified my confidence so I could take on even more substantial roles within the Backstage community.\\n\\n## Stage 4: Becoming an active community member\\n\\n![Engaging with the Open Source Community at the CNCF meetup in Toronto](assets/2025-05-12/cncf_1.jpeg)\\n_(Source: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mwijay_you-totally-missed-last-nights-first-cncf-ugcPost-7311005210628235264-8BES)_\\n\\n![Engaging with the Open Source Community at the CNCF meetup in Toronto](assets/2025-05-12/cncf_2.png)\\n_Engaging with the Open Source Community at the CNCF meetup in Toronto (Source: https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-cloud-native-toronto-presents-cncf-2025-kickoff-at-shopify/)_\\n\\nOne of the ways I got more involved was by helping with the maintenance of the [community-plugins repository](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins). For instance, I helped address a security vulnerability \u2014 specifically, that the `@backstage/backend-common package` relied on a vulnerable version of `jsonpath-plus` through `@kubernetes/client-node`. I proactively removed this vulnerable dependency from eight plugins, effectively safeguarding those plugins from potential risks. I also focused on improving dependency management by implementing Knip reports. These reports help us identify and remove unused dependencies, keeping the repository clean and efficient.\\n\\nBeyond repository maintenance, I also began focusing on community engagement. I began reviewing pull requests regularly, helping maintain code quality and lightening the load on other maintainers. This not only deepened my understanding of the codebase but also exposed me to new features and patterns across the ecosystem. I actively participated in SIG meetings and offered guidance to fellow contributors on Discord.\\n\\nThis marked a turning point in my journey, as I transitioned from a contributor to an active community member. Eventually, this growing involvement led to me becoming a maintainer for the community-plugins repository. It was a fulfilling step forward, and it felt rewarding to be trusted with more responsibility in guiding the project.\\n\\n## What\u2019s next: future steps as a maintainer\\n\\n![Presenting \\"From Zero to Contributor: My Open Source Journey with Backstage\\" at the CNCF 2025 Kickoff event at Shopify, Toronto](assets/2025-05-12/cncf_3.jpeg)\\n_Presenting \\"From Zero to Contributor: My Open Source Journey with Backstage\\" at the CNCF 2025 Kickoff event at Shopify, Toronto (Source: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mwijay_you-totally-missed-last-nights-first-cncf-ugcPost-7311005210628235264-8BES)_\\n\\nAs a maintainer, my focus is on supporting others in their open source journey and improving the overall contributor experience.

[Five years][birthday] after the open source framework was released, Backstage was clearly on people\'s minds \u2014 from those new to internal developer portals to those who have been contributing since the earliest days. Conversations about Backstage spanned from BackstageCon to the rest of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe, which had a record-setting attendance of nearly 13,000 people. But if you couldn\'t make it, then settle in, prepare a spot of tea, and read on for highlights. Then head over to the Backstage Community\'s YouTube channel to [catch up on all the great Backstage talks][playlist] you missed.\\n\\n[birthday]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74ayHL1WHiE&list=PL8iP9yIjU0Q3K8LV_a9CcFmhvvNTAUzL1\\n[playlist]: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8iP9yIjU0Q3K8LV_a9CcFmhvvNTAUzL1\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## London called \u2014 the Backstage Community answered\\n\\n![The crowds at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2025 set a new record for attendance](assets/2025-04-29/kc25london-crowds-entering.jpg)\\n\u{1F4F8} _[CNCF][flickr]_\\n\\n## Scenes from BackstageCon\\n\\n![Thank you to our BackstageCon sponsors: Red Hat, Roadie, Spotify, Port](assets/2025-04-29/kc25london-sponsors.jpg)\\n\u{1F4F8} _[CNCF][flickr]_\\n\\nKicking the week off was the fifth-ever BackstageCon \u2014 a full day of talks featuring voices and perspectives from across the community. Here are just a few of the highlights from the day.\\n\\n### #1: [Unlocking Backstage\'s Potential: Driving Adoption and Maturity With Your Developer Community][1]\\n\\n![Stanley Nicholl from Spotify presents at BackstageCon Europe 2025](assets/2025-04-29/kc25london-spotify.png)\\n\\nLearn how to bridge the gap between the lofty ROI numbers you\'ve read about and your own experiences. Spotify\'s Stanley Nicholl shares his insights for how to unlock internal Backstage adoption by tapping into your greatest resource: your internal developer community.\\n\\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg3ANYLyFoM&list=PL8iP9yIjU0Q3K8LV_a9CcFmhvvNTAUzL1\\n\\n### #2: [Panel: What Do Cars, Clothes, Wardrobes and MRI Machines Have in Common?][2]\\n\\n![Philips, H&M Group, IKEA, and Volvo Cars formed a super-panel of Backstage adopters at BackstageCon Europe 2025](assets/2025-04-29/kc25london-panel.jpg)\\n\u{1F4F8} _[CNCF][flickr]_\\n\\nIf that riddle of a title doesn\'t pull you in, I\'m not sure what else to say! This panel \u2014 featuring Scott Guymer (Philips), Remi Higuchi & Tina Vincent (H&M Group), Jan Magnusson (IKEA), and Martin W\xe4nersk\xe4r (Volvo Cars) \u2014 brings a diverse group of Backstage adopters together. It\'s well worth hearing their different impact and success stories, and comparing their perspectives on the business case for developer portals.\\n\\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6BgF9dQDNo&list=PL8iP9yIjU0Q3K8LV_a9CcFmhvvNTAUzL1\\n\\n### #3: [Lightning Talk: We Built a Unified AI Asset Catalog in Backstage][3]\\n\\n![John Collier from Red Hat presents at BackstageCon Europe 2025](assets/2025-04-29/kc25london-redhat.jpg)\\n\u{1F4F8} _[CNCF][flickr]_\\n\\nWith all the various AI tools out there, it\'s becoming hard to keep track of them all. But with the Catalog in Backstage, this becomes much easier. John Collier from Red Hat walks through how they approached this problem space internally as their inventory of AI tools \u2014 inference servers, models, and API gateways \u2014 grew and grew.\\n\\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUR_2Nk0v4E&list=PL8iP9yIjU0Q3K8LV_a9CcFmhvvNTAUzL1\\n\\n### #4: [Exemplar-y Backstage Templates][4]\\n\\n![Brent Swish from ITHAKA presents at BackstageCon Europe 2025](assets/2025-04-29/kc25london-ithaka.png)\\n\\nThe heart of offering your platform in a self-service way is to use Software Templates. What if you could make the templates themselves easier to update and contribute to? Brent Swisher from educational nonprofit ITHAKA walks through how they came up with a technique called \u201Cexemplar\u201D templates to speed up the process of creating and updating templates, making them more accessible to other devs and easier to maintain.\\n\\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY7fVOVsK_A&list=PL8iP9yIjU0Q3K8LV_a9CcFmhvvNTAUzL1\\n\\n### #5: [From Click To Chaos: Linking Argo Workflows and Backstage for Automated Testing][5]\\n\\n![Chris Heisz and Luke Beamish from Neo4j presents at BackstageCon Europe 2025](assets/2025-04-29/kc25london-neo4j.png)\\n\\nThis talk by Chris Heisz and Luke Beamish from graph technology specialists, Neo4j, is a great showcase of how you can use the Scaffolder along with Argo Workflows to offer self-service integration and chaos testing. See how they ensure thousands of Kubernetes clusters are stable and performant.

Busy Backstage beavers, indeed.\\n\\nAnd the community was as active as ever in 2024 \u2014 if you hit play on the visualization above, you can see all 12.3k commits from the year being made.

We see official plugins from popular third-party service providers ([DX](https://backstage.spotify.com/marketplace/dx/plugin/dx/), [PagerDuty](https://pagerduty.github.io/backstage-plugin-docs/index.html), [Rootly](https://backstage.spotify.com/marketplace/rootly/plugin/rootly/)), in-house plugins going open source (like these from [DAZN](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/blob/main/workspaces/github-pull-requests-board/plugins/github-pull-requests-board/README.md), [Keyloop](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/blob/main/workspaces/azure-devops/plugins/azure-devops/README.md), and [SeatGeek](https://github.com/seatgeek/backstage-plugins)), essential plugins built and maintained by ecosystem champions and supporters ([AWS](https://github.com/awslabs/backstage-plugins-for-aws), [GCP](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/google-cloud-backstage-plugins), [Roadie](https://roadie.io), [Spotify](https://backstage.spotify.com)), as well as creative and [useful](https://github.com/procore-oss/backstage-plugin-announcements) plugins from contributors and enthusiasts from all corners of the Backstage community.\\n\\n### A yearlong plugin party\\n\\nIn 2024, the plugin ecosystem continued to expand \u2014 with about a hundred new plugins being introduced over the year and many others getting big updates.\\n\\nSeatGeek started the plugin party in February\u2744\uFE0F at a Backstage Community Session where they [demoed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRw0m3J11Bc&t=526s) five of the seven plugins they\'ve open sourced, including their [Awards Plugin](https://github.com/seatgeek/backstage-plugins/tree/main/plugins/awards) and [Entity Scaffolder Plugin](https://github.com/seatgeek/backstage-plugins/tree/main/plugins/entity-scaffolder-content).\\n\\nBy spring\u{1F337}, new plugins for [Linkerd](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/linkerd) and [Black Duck](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/blackduck/plugins/blackduck) had sprung onto the scene.\\n\\nDuring the summer\u2600\uFE0F, the official [PagerDuty](https://pagerduty.github.io/backstage-plugin-docs/index.html) plugin received updates that made it a breeze to configure existing PagerDuty services and also added support for multiple PagerDuty accounts in the same Backstage instance.\\n\\nBy fall\u{1F341}, some of the most-used plugins \u2014 including plugins for [Argo CD](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@roadiehq/backstage-plugin-argo-cd), [Datadog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@roadiehq/backstage-plugin-datadog), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/github-actions/plugins/github-actions), [Grafana](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/blob/main/workspaces/grafana/plugins/grafana/docs/index.md), [Jira](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/backstage-plugins/tree/main/plugins/jira-dashboard), [Kubernetes](https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/), and [Tech Radar](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/tech-radar/plugins/tech-radar) \u2014 had already been updated to support the very latest versions of the Backstage framework\'s [New Frontend System](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.30.0) and [New Backend System](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/24493). (Thanks to the teams at Roadie and Spotify for helping to kickstart a new era of easy-to-install-and-configure plugins!)\\n\\nAnd last but not least, AWS just released the [AWS Config catalog plugin for Backstage](https://github.com/awslabs/backstage-plugins-for-aws/blob/main/plugins/core/catalog-config/README.md) \u2014 a great new plugin that makes it easy for their customers to ingest AWS resources into the Backstage Software Catalog.\\n\\nHave a plugin you\'d like to show off and share with the community? Sign up to demo it at one of our monthly [Backstage Community Sessions](https://github.com/backstage/community/tree/main/backstage-community-sessions#readme)!\\n\\n### A shiny new plugins repo\\n\\nAlongside all this plugin-building action, there was also plenty of plugin-migrating action. In April, community plugins moved to a repo they could call their own \u2014 the [Backstage Community Plugins Repository](https://backstage.io/blog/2024/04/19/community-plugins/).\\n\\nWith release tooling, workspace tooling, and migration guide all included, [the new repo](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins) gives plugin owners a leg up on building and shipping plugins. Now you can release independently of the main monorepo, at your own release cadence.\\n\\nSpecial thanks go to Red Hat as maintainers of the [community plugins project area](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/OWNERS.md#community-plugins) and to everyone who provided feedback on the migration plan. With the new community plugins repo now established, it will be fascinating to see what new, innovative plugins we\'ll be talking about this time next year.

And that was just in the last six months.\\n\\nBut the 1.0 release of the New Backend System was the biggie of the year.\\n\\n### The \\"New Backend System\\" becomes _the_ backend system\\n\\nAfter months of testing, feedback, and improvements with the community, the New Backend System landed as a [stable v.1.0 release](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.31.0/) in September \u2014 marking the beginning of a new era for building for Backstage.\\n\\nThe New Backend System (which shall henceforth be known as \\"_the_ backend system\\") brings a host of improvements to the way that backends and their features are constructed. Instead of the old convention-based structure that could lead to migration pains, features now fit together with dependency injection, like a jigsaw puzzle, while leveraging powerful core services and extending each other dynamically with additional behaviors.\\n\\nAnd this is just scratching the surface of it. To see what else is new in the backend system \u2014 check out [the docs](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/)!\\n\\nWe are very excited about this important milestone after a long period of development and refinement together with our passionate community, and hope that you will find it as refreshing and simple yet powerful as it was envisioned to be. This also lays the foundation for us being able to continue iterating at a high pace without incurring undue end user breakages during upgrades.\\n\\n### How to migrate your backends and plugins\\n\\nWe have documentation for both [migrating backends](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/building-backends/migrating) and [migrating plugins](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/building-plugins-and-modules/migrating). If you haven\'t migrated already, we encourage you to do so as soon as possible, so that all adopters and end users can begin to unlock the benefits of the new system!\\n\\nAnd keep the feedback coming, either on the community [Discord](https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673) or through [issues](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/new/choose) on GitHub. If you\'re looking for a way to help, take a look at these open issues in the [backstage](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/26353) and [community plugins](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/issues/1176) repos about deprecating old backend capabilities of already migrated plugins. To the future we go!\\n\\n---\\n\\n## We won! Hooray to the community! \u{1F3C6}\\n\\n![Bowie the Backstage Beaver standing bashfully on a podium with 2024 flashing behind in big letters](assets/2024-12-18/wrapped2024-infoworld.gif)\\n\\nTo cap off the year, last week Backstage won the \\"[InfoWorld 2024 Technology of the Year Award for Software Development: Platforms](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/backstage-from-spotify_infoworlds-2024-technology-of-the-year-award-activity-7273338824561246208-KY-w/)\\"!\\n\\nCongrats to [all the project maintainers](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/OWNERS.md), the CNCF, and everyone in the Backstage community \u2014 including all our contributors, adopters, partners, and end users.

Today, we\u2019re releasing the report from the second independent security audit of the Backstage project.\\n\\n![Backstage Security Audit & Updates](assets/22-08-23/backstage-security-audit.png)\\n\\nAs an [Incubating project](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/15/backstage-project-joins-the-cncf-incubator/) within the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF), Backstage is fortunate enough to take advantage of sponsored continuous security audits. The [Open Source Technology Improvement Fund](https://ostif.org/) (OSTIF) sponsors the audits as part of its ongoing efforts to secure the open source software ecosystem, and the audit itself was performed by [X41 D-Sec](https://x41-dsec.de/), who also performed the first audit. Our goal with the audit was to re-evaluate and further improve Backstage\u2019s security posture, focusing on the core Backstage framework and plugins.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Report Findings and Fixes\\n\\nThe security audit and improvements concluded on October 16. The audit findings totalled three high and one medium severity vulnerability, alongside seven side findings with no direct security impact. All main findings were remedied in the [Backstage 1.31 release](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.31.0), while the majority of the side findings were addressed by the [1.32 release](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.32.0). For details on all findings, see the [full audit report](assets/2024-12-17/X41-Backstage-Audit-2024.pdf).\\n\\nWe are happy to see that there are no repeated vulnerabilities, perhaps in part due to our new [secure coding practices](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/SECURITY.md#coding-practices) following the previous audit, as well as the introduction of the [Backstage Threat Model](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model). While there was a path traversal vulnerability that was discovered in the TechDocs backend, this was more specific and related to remote paths, rather than the local filesystem. We chose to handle this as an isolated fix as there are no other occurrences of this pattern that we are aware of.\\n\\nThe [previous security audit](https://backstage.io/blog/2022/08/23/backstage-security-audit/) highlighted the need for Backstage to have its own built-in protection, to be secure by default. This, as well as the need for more robust service-to-service auth, was addressed earlier this year through the new auth system, in [1.24](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.24.0#breaking-auth-improvements) and following releases. The new auth system was in scope for this new security audit, and no findings were made in that area.\\n\\nOne area with findings in both audits is the way that the auth plugin backend handles sign-in of users. This is a complex area that can often be a source of friction for the adoption experience of Backstage. As part of this audit we have made several updates especially to the documentation for sign-in resolvers, but this remains an area where it is hard to find a solution that is both simple and secure. Of course we err on the side of caution and have updated our documentation to be more strict. We will continue to explore options for improvements to the sign-in system to keep it both simple and secure out of the box, but in the meantime be sure to read the documentation section [sign-in identity and resolver](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/identity-resolver) as you are setting up Backstage.\\n\\nWe are happy with the results of this security audit, it is yet another way in which we see the continuing maturity of the Backstage projects. On behalf of the Backstage maintainers and community: thanks to the CNCF, OSTIF, and X41 D-Sec for the opportunity to improve the project.\\n\\n## Links and References\\n\\n- [X41 Blog Post](https://x41-dsec.de/security/research/job/news/2024/12/16/backstage-review-2024/)\\n- [OSTIF Blog Post](https://ostif.org/backstage-audit-complete/)\\n- [Full Audit Report](assets/2024-12-17/X41-Backstage-Audit-2024.pdf)\\n- [Backstage Threat Model](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model)\\n- [Backstage Security Policy](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/SECURITY.md)"},{"id":"/2024/12/09/kubecon-slc-24","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/12/09/kubecon-slc-24","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-09-kubecon-slc-24.mdx","title":"Backstage in Salt Lake City: Highlights from BackstageCon and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2024","description":"Beaver in front of snowcapped mountains peeking over a banner that reads BackstageCon and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2024, Salt Lake City","date":"2024-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":10.54,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\xe9 Wanlin, Spotify & Camila Loiola, Spotify","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Backstage in Salt Lake City: Highlights from BackstageCon and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2024","author":"Andr\xe9 Wanlin, Spotify & Camila Loiola, Spotify"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The 2024 Backstage Security Audit","permalink":"/blog/2024/12/17/backstage-security-audit-2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"Adopter Spotlight: Level-up developer experience with observability and security in context","permalink":"/blog/2024/09/24/dynatrace-adopter-spotlight"}},"content":"![Beaver in front of snowcapped mountains peeking over a banner that reads BackstageCon and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2024, Salt Lake City](assets/2024-12-09/backstagecon-kubecon-2024-salt-lake-city.png)\\n\\n**tl;dr:** Salt Lake City did not disappoint!

The server component was particularly large, consisting of 260 Gradle projects in a single repository. This setup centralized development processes for the developers, making it easier for them to push the code while versioning, delivery, and hotfixes were handled automatically. However, maintaining the speed and manageability of these processes required a lot of effort.\\n\\nDynatrace decided to move towards the current Dynatrace platform model as the next evolutionary step of our product. This decision led to an architectural change of splitting the monolithic repository into multiple projects. The platform is designed to enable the development of apps on top of platform capabilities to unlock faster innovations and decouple them from the release cycles of other components. Based on this decision, it became apparent that the number of platform components and individual apps would increase significantly, eliminating the option of a single repository to unify all processes. Besides, the risk of increasing cognitive load in software development was high due to development being spread across multiple touchpoints, a challenge discussed in research for years ([Sweller, 1988](<https://doi.org/10.1016/0364-0213(88)90023-7>), [Robert, 2008](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1388398)). Consequently, the need to standardize project creation became crucial to ensure corporate governance and compliance even before the first commit was pushed.\\n\\n\x3c!-- References:\\n[^1]: John Sweller, Cognitive load during problem solving: Effects on learning, Cognitive Science, Volume 12, Issue 2, 1988, Pages 257-285, ISSN 0364-0213, https://doi.org/10.1016/0364-0213(88)90023-7.\\n[^2]: Robert C.

This effort was initially named \u201Cproject initializer\u201D and launched around the same time Backstage joined the CNCF. Although the platform engineering team saw initial success with the project initializer, we quickly realized that there was a greater demand for centralizing development activities and providing appropriate guidelines. For example, we noted that the complexity of integrating new code had shifted from the build phase to the deployment phase, transferring relatively complex integration tasks from continuous integration to continuous deployment. Overall, the main requirements and focal points were:\\n\\n- **Ownership**: Who is responsible for which service or app? Who owns infrastructure resources?\\n- **Documentation**: Where is the documentation of a service or app?\\n- **CI/CD view**: How does the build pipeline in GitHub/Jenkins progress, and what about the ArgoCD deployment?\\n- **Dependency management**: Do we know which APIs are used?\\n- **Observability and security**: Where is a service deployed, and is it healthy and secure?\\n\\nFor more details on Dynatrace\'s adoption of Backstage, please watch the recording, [How We Made Backstage Improve Developer Efficiency of 1000+ Engineers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0or5K_3HieA), BackstageCon, November 6, 2023 in Chicago. Illinois.\\n\\n## Quick wins with ownership democratization and self-service templates\\n\\nThe discussion on whether to make, buy, or adopt led us to heavily favor Backstage as the chosen solution for our internal developer platform (IDP). We have successfully integrated Backstage within Dynatrace, marking our early wins. This was accomplished by linking it to our internal team management solution. Feeding this data into Backstage resolved the previously lacking transparency concerning the responsibilities and ownership of services and infrastructure. Furthermore, we have contextualized Stack Overflow and CI/CD solutions with entities monitored by Backstage to fulfill developers\' requests for a unified view.\\n\\nNext to establishing a solid software catalog view, providing self-service templates for project and infrastructure creation\u2014initially a focus of the original developer experience\u2014has also been incorporated into Backstage. This enhancement allows the use of a comprehensive set of templates for bootstrapping platform services or applications across different tool stacks. Ultimately, developers can effortlessly use a template to create a ready-to-use repository with observability and security pre-configured.\\n\\n## Static model enrichment with real-time observability and security\\n\\nAfter addressing ownership, documentation, and a centralized CI/CD view, our developers highlighted the necessity of accessing real-time data about their services and applications within the Backstage service catalog. This need arose from the understanding that integrating a code change can be optimally evaluated on a deployed version of their service alongside related components. Specifically, the developers were interested in seeing at a high level:\\n\\n- Where specific versions of services are deployed,\\n- How their services perform in the hardening phase and production environments,\\n- Which inbound and outbound dependencies their service has,\\n- Whether any problems, security vulnerabilities, or SLO breaches are related to their service, and\\n- Which recent error logs have been collected.\\n\\nThe open source community already developed a Backstage plugin capable of fetching Dynatrace problems and synthetics into Backstage. However, we chose to develop a new plugin that works with the new Dynatrace platform API. Additionally, it was necessary to support Kubernetes use cases by default to offer, for example, deployment overviews out-of-the-box. Based on the feedback from developers, we identified four essential requirements.\\n\\n### Coverage of the software development lifecycle\\n\\nObserving the software development lifecycle necessitates consolidating all development and delivery phases. In Dynatrace, monitoring the development stage is distinct from rolling out new versions to the hardening and production stages. Nonetheless, developers desire an end-to-end view from development to production. To support this, the plugin allows connections to multiple Dynatrace environments to retrieve data for the various rollout phases.\\n\\n### Kubernetes observability\\n\\nWhen using the Backstage Kubernetes plugin, an annotation is required to surface your Kubernetes components as part of an entity (for more information, please refer to [Backstage documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration/#surfacing-your-kubernetes-components-as-part-of-an-entity)). The Dynatrace plugin utilizes this convention to automatically populate monitoring data from Kubernetes deployments into the deployment overview in Backstage. Therefore, additional configuration is unnecessary to enrich Backstage entities with real-time observability data from Kubernetes, as shown below. Additionally, deep links open Dynatrace analysis views for more contextual details.\\n\\n![Kubernetes deployment overview](assets/2024-09-24/backstage_dynatrace_plugin_K8s.png)\\n\\n### Reliability and security in context\\n\\nWhile Kubernetes observability was requested to be provided out of the box, we quickly realized that developers prefer to define the insights they want to see by themselves. To remain flexible and to reduce the customization effort required from the platform engineering teams, the plugin allows for the definition of custom queries within the `config.yaml` file. The Backstage `config.yaml` file requires special attention since platform teams use this file to standardize entity specifications, while developers use it to customize their Backstage views. After releasing this new functionality, we observed developers moving in two distinct directions:\\n\\n- Querying quality gate validation results of a new version they\u2019re developing\\n\\n![Release validation overview](assets/2024-09-24/backstage_srg_validations.png)\\n\\n- Fetching runtime security vulnerability information across different stages\\n\\n![Security vulnerabilities in context](assets/2024-09-24/backstage_catalog_security_vulnerabilities.png)\\n\\n### Error logs at hand\\n\\nDevelopers love logs. Direct access to logs, especially error logs, was a crucial requirement for the plugin. Our developers want to see the current number of error logs accompanied by a direct link to the raw log line, which provides significant value in problem triaging and fixing. With the plugin, we offer a high-level overview of log statistics, with the rich analysis capabilities of Dynatrace available at a single click.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTo enhance the developer experience, Dynatrace adopted Backstage as its central developer portal and enhances Backstage entities with real-time data. This decision, along with the symbiosis between the Dynatrace platform and Backstage, has unlocked two significant opportunities.\\n\\nFirst, centralizing all development-related artifacts and democratizing ownership have reduced onboarding time for our teams. Although it might seem that onboarding time is only relevant for new developers, it is also important when developers move to a different team, pick up a service or application they haven\u2019t worked on for a while, or replace their laptops. Moreover, a low onboarding time is crucial when quickly kicking off work on a new service or solution app. This became a necessity with the new Dynatrace platform.\\n\\nSecond, we enhanced the developer experience by integrating observability and security data into Backstage, offering seamless entry points to Dynatrace for in-depth analysis. This improvement was crucial as we noted a shift in integration tasks from build to development time, necessitating insights into a later phase of the software lifecycle for our developers. In essence, end-to-end validation of code changes could no longer be accomplished with build pipelines\u2014either in Jenkins or GitHub\u2014but required deployment in production-like environments that facilitate real-world interaction with other components. Consequently, real-time observability data from these environments must be relayed to the developer.\\n\\n## What`s next?\\n\\nBackstage is a crucial element for Dynatrace\'s developer experience, providing out-of-the-box core functionality for every developer and supporting extensibility where needed. Our Backstage extension is maintained as an open-source project and is available for every Backstage user.

I set goals for myself and developed concrete activities to reach those goals:\\n\\n### Goal 1: Learn the internal process to develop, test, secure, and publish applications.\\n\\nUnderstanding a company\u2019s practices and technologies is absolutely essential to getting started, no matter what company you join.\\n\\nAt Spotify, we use a Backstage plugin called [TechDocs](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/) to document [Golden Paths](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/) \u2014 tutorials that teach us the development process for each role at the company \u2014 for web, backend, mobile, data science development, and so on.\\n\\nWith Backstage, I had an understanding of how to put things into production, even before I had my first task. I used the web Golden Path to guide me on setting up my environment; creating and structuring projects; and building, publishing, and monitoring production applications.\\n\\n> **Reflection:**<br/>_\u201CIs it easy for newly hired engineers to settle in and find information critical to getting started?\u201D_\\n\\nWith Backstage, new hires can quickly and easily understand the nuances of their particular positions and be ready to deliver their first task to production.\\n\\n### Goal 2: Find and read the documentation and source code of the products my team maintains.\\n\\nHaving familiarized myself with the ways of working, it was a good time to understand my specific team\u2019s business domain. This meant spending time reading through documentation and source code to find out the value we provide to our customers. In the past, I would spend time with colleagues for knowledge transfer as opposed to learning on my own and consult my colleagues if needed.\\n\\nWith the [Backstage Software Catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/), I could easily browse the components my team owns, find the source repo and documentation.\\n\\n> **Reflection:**<br/>_\u201CAre you able to accomplish this without asking a teammate for help?\u201D_\\n\\nUse Backstage to get to know the products that you will be working on, and use your peers\' time to ask contextualized clarifying questions instead.\\n\\n### Goal 3: Figure out where my team fits within the company and with other teams.\\n\\nIt was also crucial for me to build a network from the beginning so that I could explore collaboration opportunities.\\n\\nAt Spotify, we use a Backstage plugin called Band Manager which displays information about each team and allows employees to see not only their own teams but also those within the same product area and company domain.\\n\\n> **Reflection:**<br/>_\u201CAre you going to need a one-on-one with your manager to ask this question?\u201D_\\n\\nBackstage helped me find the teams close to mine, and I took the opportunity to develop my network and talk to members from those teams to understand our boundaries and gather ideas to contribute.\\n\\nIt\u2019s pretty likely that you can relate to one or more of these examples, so use Backstage to support your goals from the very beginning!\\n\\nNow let\u2019s move on to the middle of the journey, between six months and two years into life at the company.\\n\\n## Two years in \u2014 from contributor to leader\\n\\nAfter about two years of contributing to my team\u2019s products, I began to look for opportunities to actually lead initiatives and create a new project. One of my objectives was to ensure I was upholding Spotify\u2019s standards and choosing Spotify-approved technologies.\\n\\nMy goal has changed from being a contributor to being the driver, i.e., from doing what I was told to do to defining what needed to be done. I \u201Cstarted driving initiatives\u201D and \u201Csupporting my peers\u201D in order to position myself as a reference in my technical area.\\n\\n### Goal 1: Quickly spin up new projects using the most appropriate technology stack.\\n\\nAt Spotify, we expect engineers to use technologies approved by our [Tech Radar](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/05/14/tech-radar-plugin/#what-is-tech-radar) and follow the best quality standards.\\n\\nTo do so, we use a plugin called [Scaffolder](https://backstage.io/api/stable/modules/_backstage_plugin-scaffolder.html) (aka Software Templates), which allows engineers to create templates for setting up new projects. Templates automate actions such as creating repositories, allocating resources, registering in the catalog, configuring deployments, and connecting to other internal systems.\\n\\n> **Reflection:**<br/>_\u201CDo you need to create a ticket to get these things done before you even start coding? And is there a lot of time spent looking for boilerplate code to start a new project and connecting it to other internal systems?\\"_\\n\\nBackstage enabled me to quickly create and publish a new backend that can deploy code to production with just a few clicks, so I could focus on building solutions for the business. I could use Backstage to easily build the right thing. Instead of spending time scaffolding projects, I could spend my time writing code.\\n\\n### Goal 2: Create products that have a healthy operational state and are easy to evolve.\\n\\nKeeping track of vulnerabilities and letting my team know about technical debts were other parts of my routine.\\n\\nWith the [Soundcheck plugin](https://backstage.spotify.com/marketplace/spotify/plugin/soundcheck/), developers can easily configure checks to verify component health, such as reliability and other development and operational standards. We also have an internal Vulnerabilities plugin that displays fragilities in our components, so we can continuously prevent security issues.\\n\\n> **Reflection:**<br/>_\u201CDo you know which components owned by your team follows best practices and standards and which ones are lagging behind?\u201D_\\n\\nBackstage helped me gather and better understand our technical debts, enabling me to effectively prioritize during our team\u2019s planning, visualize which entities were compliant to our team\u2019s best practices, and identify which ones needed improvement.\\n\\n### Goal 3: Respond effectively to incidents within our components or their dependencies.\\n\\nIf you\u2019ve been with a company for around two years, you might have had to manage incidents in one way or another \u2014 this was certainly the case for me. A typical problem was to determine if the issue is with the service that I own or a downstream dependency.\\n\\nSpotify has adopted [PagerDuty](https://backstage.spotify.com/marketplace/pagerduty/plugin/pagerduty/) to manage on-call rotation and to track incident resolutions. We integrated the PagerDuty plugin in Backstage, so we see who is on call and if there is an incident for a particular component.\\n\\n> **Reflection:**<br/>_\u201CWhen a downstream dependency is failing, do you know who to contact?\u201D_\\n\\nIn the event that one of our components starts failing, I check whether any of the systems we rely on is experiencing an incident, and Backstage again makes it easy for me to see the dependencies between systems and the status of those dependencies.\\n\\n## Today and beyond!\\n\\nWith three-plus years of experience at Spotify, I\u2019m taking on more and more responsibility by embracing challenges outside my team\u2019s scope, coordinating cross-team collaboration, attending and facilitating courses for personal development and growth, and mentoring my peers.\\n\\nBackstage has allowed me to drive my pursuit of growth in a multitude of ways.\\n\\n### Goal 1: Stay in the flow and optimize my time management practices.\\n\\nAt this point, finding time to focus \u2014 with all that I have on my plate \u2014 while also making time to learn new concepts is both fundamental and challenging for me.\\n\\nSpotify encourages its developers to manage their time in order to stay in the flow and to turn to the tools that help them prioritize effectively and focus on their work.\\n\\n> **Reflection:**<br/>_\u201CHow do you surface the most important notifications and avoid non-emergency distractions?\u201D_\\n\\nBackstage has been instrumental in helping me stay in the flow by surfacing the most critical notifications and call to actions related to cost spikes, security vulnerabilities in my homepage.\\n\\n### Goal 2: Platformize our solutions and reuse code to boost my productivity.\\n\\nReinventing the wheel is a common problem in software development and Spotify is no different.\\n\\nAutonomous teams tend to prioritize speed over reuse and develop the same solutions in different places (1) as it unblocks the delivery for their team and (2) there is no easy way to discover if a particular functionality has been developed in another part of the company and if it can be reused for their requirement.\\n\\n> **Reflection:**<br/>_\u201CDo you find yourself wondering if someone else already did it before starting a task?\u201D_\\n\\nWith the [Backstage Search plugin](https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/), I can discover solutions to reuse, find inspiration, and also share what I\u2019ve built for other developers to discover and use.\\n\\n### Goal 3: Grow my career and take steps toward the next level.\\n\\nI began looking for opportunities to gain new experiences and responsibilities while expanding my knowledge.\\n\\nWith Spotify\u2019s [Skill Exchange plugin](https://backstage.spotify.com/marketplace/spotify/plugin/skill-exchange/) for Backstage, engineers temporarily embed with a different team, allowing them to partake in work outside their day-to-day. The plugin also helps engineers connect with mentees or mentors that align with their skills profiles.\\n\\n> **Reflection:**<br/>_\u201CAre you able to find opportunities that match your current skill set?\u201D_\\n\\nWith Backstage, I\'ve applied for an embed to experience working with another team and eventually make a permanent move to this new team, calling it my new home.\\n\\nI am passionate about teaching and eager to share my knowledge to help others. Through Skill Exchange, I found a mentee, a colleague transitioning into engineering, and I am helping them take their first steps.\\n\\n## What\u2019s next?\\n\\nBackstage is highly customizable, and with its extensive plugin ecosystem, engineers can use it strategically to achieve their goals.\\n\\nNo matter what point in your journey you are, you can find value with [Backstage](http://backstage.io).

One of the ideas was to create a dedicated home for community plugins, with all the burden of release tooling and workspace tooling already set up, which is a pretty big barrier for people wanting to create plugins for Backstage in their own organization or personal account. These plugins would then have the ability to release independently of the main monorepo, and have their own release cadence, which is something that we\'ve been looking at exploring for a while.\\n\\nWith Red Hat wanting to join forces and help get this set up, this is the path that we picked, and the last few months have been a lot of hard work from both sides getting this repository in shape and coming up with a deprecation plan for these plugins in the main repository.\\n\\nWould also like to give a shoutout to all the [Community Plugins project area](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/OWNERS.md#community-plugins) maintainers, who have been helping get us to this state! [@vinzscam](https://github.com/vinzscam) [@tudi2d](https://github.com/tudi2d) [@bethgriggs](https://github.com/BethGriggs) [@kadel](https://github.com/kadel) [@awanlin](https://github.com/awanlin) \u{1F44F}\\n\\nAnd now with the release of `1.26.3` there\'s a large amount of plugins from the main monorepo that have been migrated over to the new [community plugins repository](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins). :tada:\\n\\n## The migration\\n\\nWith the moving of these plugins, we thought it would also be a good time to move the `npm` scope, so that end users can differentiate between Backstage packages, and community-maintained packages. So the `@backstage-community` namespace was born!\\n\\nThis makes migration a little tricky for end users, as there\'s going to be code references and `package.json` dependencies pointing to the older packages which are no longer going to be published.\\n\\nWe\'ve added some tooling into the `@backstage/cli` which is going to smooth the transition here. The last versions which are published under the `@backstage/` scope from the monorepo, will have a special field in the `package.json` with a hint to the CLI as to what this package is now called.\\n\\nThe CLI will then be able to replace these references inside the `./src` folder of your codebase, and update your `package.json` dependencies to the new `@backstage-community` scope.\\n\\nYou can migrate today by running the following:\\n\\n```bash\\n# < 1.26.1\\nyarn backstage-cli versions:bump\\nyarn backstage-cli versions:migrate\\n\\n# 1.26.1\\nyarn backstage-cli versions:bump --skip-migrate\\nyarn backstage-cli versions:migrate\\n```\\n\\nFrom this latest `1.26.3` release and onwards, the `backstage-cli versions:bump` command will automatically check for moved packages, so you shouldn\'t have to worry about running this every time.\\n\\n## Help! My plugin has been moved!\\n\\nNo stress! If you were a `CODEOWNER` of the code in the monorepo, these permissions will be migrated over to the [community plugins repository](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins) so you should still have access to the code. And now you\'re in charge of releasing your own plugin! \u{1F680} You can do that by following the same flow from the monorepo, with changesets and merging the `Version Packages (My Plugin)` PR.\\n\\nPlease reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/backstage-687207715902193673) if you have any issues! We\'re looking forward to working together in the new space!\\n\\n## What\'s moved?\\n\\nWe\'ve taken a pretty big chunk of the plugins from the main monorepo and moved them over to the new repository. There could be more plugins over time that are moved, or even ones that we promote back to the main monorepo.\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>\\n    Here\'s a list of plugins that have been moved with this release\\n  </summary>\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-adr-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-adr-common`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-adr`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-airbrake-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-airbrake`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-allure`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-analytics-module-ga`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-analytics-module-ga4`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-analytics-module-newrelic-browser`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-apache-airflow`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-apollo-explorer`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-azure-devops-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-azure-devops-common`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-azure-devops`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-azure-sites-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-azure-sites-common`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-azure-sites`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-badges-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-badges`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-bazaar-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-bazaar`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-bitrise`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-cicd-statistics-module-gitlab`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-cicd-statistics`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-circleci`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-cloudbuild`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-code-climate`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-code-coverage-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-code-coverage`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-codescene`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-cost-insights-common`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-cost-insights`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-dynatrace`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-entity-feedback-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-entity-feedback-common`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-entity-feedback`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-entity-validation`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-explore-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-explore-common`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-explore-react`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-explore`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-firehydrant`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-fossa`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-gcalendar`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-gcp-projects`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-git-release-manager`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-github-actions`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-github-deployments`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-github-issues`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-github-pull-requests-board`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-gitops-profiles`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-gocd`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-graphiql`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-graphql-voyager`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-ilert`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-jenkins-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-jenkins-common`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-jenkins`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-kafka-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-kafka`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-lighthouse-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-lighthouse-common`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-lighthouse`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-linguist`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-linguist-common`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-linguist-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-microsoft-calendar`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-newrelic-dashboard`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-newrelic`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-nomad`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-nomad-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-octopus-deploy`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-opencost`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-periskop-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-periskop`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-playlist-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-playlist-common`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-playlist`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-puppetdb`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-rollbar-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-rollbar`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-sentry`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-shortcuts`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-sonarqube-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-sonarqube-react`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-sonarqube`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-splunk-on-call`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-stack-overflow-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-stack-overflow`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-stackstorm`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-tech-insights-backend-module-jsonfc`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-tech-insights-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-tech-insights-common`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-tech-insights-node`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-tech-insights`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-tech-radar`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-vault-backend`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-vault-node`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-vault`\\n\\n- `@backstage/plugin-xcmetrics`\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nThere\'s going to be a little bit of time now in this migration period where there\'s going to be issues and pull requests not in the right place, and we\'re going to do our best to transfer issues to the community plugins repository instead.

Has it already been four years since we open sourced Backstage? What an amazing run it\'s been so far. We continue to see the rate of pull requests steadily increase, the attendance and number of [special interest groups](https://github.com/backstage/community/tree/main/sigs) (SIGs) has grown, and more people are dedicating their time to new [project areas](https://github.com/backstage/community/tree/main/project-areas)!\\n\\n## Day 1: BackstageCon arrives in Europe\\n\\nThis was the third BackstageCon and the first to take place outside North America. As you can see, it started with a bang.\\n\\n![BackstageCon Europe 2024](assets/2024-03-27/backstagecon-europe-2024.jpg)\\nVia [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.flickr.com/photos/143247548@N03/albums/72177720315561784/) on Flickr\\n\\nWith hosts like [Balaji Sivasubramanian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/balajisiva) (Head of Product Management, Red Hat) and [Helen Greul](https://se.linkedin.com/in/elenagreul) (Head of Engineering for Backstage, Spotify) [kicking things off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwVUW8is_WY&list=PLj6h78yzYM2P4KPyeDFexAVm6ZvfAWMU8&index=2), how could BackstageCon Europe not be a smashing success!\\n\\nMore highlights from the day:\\n\\n- **Happy alignment:** Do you know when teams really need to be aligned? When they\'re working at a bank. [Thomas Gr\xf8nb\xe6k](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-gr\xf8nb\xe6k/) (Senior Manager, Bankdata) gave an exciting talk about how \u201C[Backstage Made 500+ Developers Happy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2P4KPyeDFexAVm6ZvfAWMU8)\u201D in the highly regulated banking industry.\\n- **Scaling up:** On the topic of scaling Backstage \u2014 a frequent subject on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/backstage-687207715902193673) \u2014 [Vincenzo Scamporlino](https://se.linkedin.com/in/vincenzoscamporlino) (Senior Software Engineer, Spotify) gave us [his recommendations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2P4KPyeDFexAVm6ZvfAWMU8) that will be helpful for many adopters who want to bring their instance to the next level.\\n- **Lightning round:** There were several awesome [lightning talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2P4KPyeDFexAVm6ZvfAWMU8) on varying topics \u2014 dynamic plugins, accessibility, OpenAPI tooling, and localization \u2014 that left you running to your laptop to learn more!\\n- **Bonus:** Next door at Platform Engineering Day, [Samantha Coffman](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/samanthacoffman) (Senior Product Manager, Spotify) was representing Backstage in her talk \\"[Boosting Developer Platform Teams with Product Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_KCOcoliLI&list=PLj6h78yzYM2Me-TpMQFvCphDu_xm71ed_&index=12)\\".\\n\\nBeyond the talks, it was great to meet so many different members of the community, both those who\'ve been using Backstage since the beginning as well as people who are just learning about internal developer portals and the open source platform. I had so many great conversations, I started to lose my voice \u2014 and it was only the first day.\\n\\n## Day 2: Onward to KubeCon + CloudNativeCon\\n\\nBackstage also took the spotlight at KubeCon. On Wednesday, project maintainers [Patrik Oldsberg](https://github.com/Rugvip) (Senior Engineer, Spotify) and [Ben Lambert](https://github.com/benjdlambert) (Senior Engineer, Spotify) gave us a great overview on \u201C[The State of Backstage in 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBf3g79xcf4)\u201D to a packed audience. Highlights from their talk include:\\n\\n- **New project areas:** There are now project areas for Community Plugins, Notifications, and the Scaffolder\\n- **BEPs (Backstage enhancement proposals):** This is a new formal proposal process that allows a more iterative approach then trying to use GitHub Issues as RFCs\\n- **Core framework:** They gave updates on the new auth changes to be secure by default, as well as updates on the New Backend System and New Frontend System\\n- **The future:** Dynamic features!

If you weren\'t able to join us, the [BackstageCon talks are available](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2PxiInfZi2OKu1KluNfbLtc) for replay on the CNCF YouTube channel.\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nObviously we\'re biased, but Backstage was definitely one of the big topics at [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/) this year. Recently, the CNCF announced that Backstage was the [third fastest-growing project](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/10/27/october-2023-where-we-are-with-velocity-of-cncf-lf-and-top-30-open-source-projects/) of the year (up from the fifth last year). And you could confirm it with your own eyes during BackstageCon and KubeCon: hundreds of people flocked through the event, talks, and the project booth sharing their enthusiasm and asking more questions about the project.\\n\\n### BackstageCon: A growing community\xa0\\n\\nWith a whopping peak attendance of 400+ people, the crowd nearly doubled from last year,[ taking the center stage of the conference](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2023/11/14/backstage-project-takes-center-stage-at-kubecon-north-america-2023/?sh=1972303a6539), as reported by Forbes. For some, BackstageCon was their first entry point into the community, but the event also boasted lots of\xa0 familiar faces, mostly from some of the most mature adopters such as Dynatrace, Lunar, and US Bank. We also got to hear from new voices in the community like Comcast and Grafana Labs.\\n\\nWe hear a lot of great questions such as:\\n\\n- How do I make more developers use my developer portal?\\n\\n- Will generative AI take my Backstage instance to the next level?\\n\\n- What\'s all the fuss around the upcoming Declarative Integration in Backstage?\\n\\nThe community got together to discuss these and more questions with exciting talks and debates. The talks were all recorded and are [up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2PxiInfZi2OKu1KluNfbLtc), so make sure to check them out.\\n\\n**Driving Backstage adoption**\\n\\nGrowing adoption was top of mind during BackstageCon. David Tuite, CEO of Roadie, shared the lessons learned from interviewing 20 adopters, which revealed that the Scaffolder was a prime place to get started when adopting Backstage, as it lets stakeholders get an easily measurable ROI.\\n\\n![Panel of Backstage adopters](assets/23-11-15/10-panel.jpg)\\n\\nHelen Greul, Head of Engineering for Backstage at Spotify, hosted [a panel discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iti5glzYOG8&list=PLj6h78yzYM2PxiInfZi2OKu1KluNfbLtc&index=10) with four adopters that are using Backstage at scale: Twilio, Lunar Bank, US Bank, and Expedia. The crucial role of Backstage in fostering inner sourcing and simplifying new hires onboarding were a few of the subjects covered in the panel.\\n\\nHow adopters are using Backstage was also a highlight of the day. B3, Brazil\'s Stock Exchange, shared [how they\'re building their developer portal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyWCKIVYO7g&list=PLj6h78yzYM2PxiInfZi2OKu1KluNfbLtc&index=14). And from Grafana Labs, we heard how they\'re using [Backstage along Crossplane to drive GitOps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-JUWob69Hw&list=PLj6h78yzYM2PxiInfZi2OKu1KluNfbLtc&index=10).\\n\\n**What\'s next with Backstage?**\\n\\nThe discussion on how Backstage is evolving was featured in a few talks, through live demos that \u2014 remarkably \u2014 did not go wrong even once! Ben ([benjdlambert](https://github.com/benjdlambert)) and Patrik ([Rugvip](https://github.com/Rugvip)), core maintainers, presented an introduction to the plans around [Declarative Integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hVMNMXXN44&list=PLj6h78yzYM2PxiInfZi2OKu1KluNfbLtc&index=8), which will allow people to install plugins without dealing with TypeScript or React. On the other hand, Djamaile and Mitch, from Spotify, [introduced the upcoming Quickstart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUdaO9NKXJY&list=PLj6h78yzYM2PxiInfZi2OKu1KluNfbLtc&index=12), a tool from Spotify in private-beta that will allow anyone to get started with Backstage through a GUI in a few steps.\\n\\n**A thriving community**\\n\\nPeople gathered outside the conference room where BackstageCon was happening to catch up with each other and learn from the event sponsors. It was great to connect with everyone and talk about how everyone is using Backstage.\\n\\n![KubeCon Attendees](assets/23-11-15/20-booth.jpg)\\n\\n![Spotify at BackstageCon](assets/23-11-15/30-spotify-kubecon.jpg)\\n\\n### Mom, Backstage is not a phase\\n\\nThe interest from the cloud-native community in Backstage did not waver this year. Instead, the Backstage booth in the KubeCon Project Pavillion saw a nonstop flux of visitors asking more about the project. There were three talks featuring Backstage during KubeCon.\\n\\n**Backstage talks during KubeCon NA \'23**\\n\\nThe first talk touching on Backstage of the schedule was Tim Hansen\'s ([timbonicus](https://github.com/timbonicus)) \\"Everything Is Code: Embracing GitOps at Spotify,\\" who achieved rockstar status thanks to his phenomenal insights. The queue to ask questions after the talk\'s questions was surreal!\\n\\n![KubeCon Attendees](assets/23-11-15/40-tim-talk.jpg)\\n\\nBackstage maintainers Ben and Patrik addressed a full-room during their talk \u201CSimplifying Backstage - Breaking the Code Barrier\u201D in which they explained Declarative Integration, how it works and the expected migration path. Declarative Integration will enable adopters to install the plugins they use\u2014and even customize them\u2014without dealing with TypeScript or React.\\n\\n![KubeCon Attendees](assets/23-11-15/50-patrik-ben-full.jpg)\\n\\nAnd to close the event, Ritesh Patel, Nirmata and David Murphy, Upbound, introduced the BACK Stack, which stands for Backstage, Argo, Crossplane, and Kyverno. These four tools make up a powerful combo that can enable self-service workflows secure and scalable. After a great demo, the speakers presented a reference architecture that can help guide an approach to using Backstage to build your platform.\\n\\n![KubeCon Attendees](assets/23-11-15/60-back-stack.jpg)\\n\\n### See you next year!\\n\\nThe next KubeCon Europe is scheduled for March 18-22 in Paris.

Through templatization and open feedback loops, the team has conservatively saved 18 months of developer time to date with Backstage. We spoke with CTC DevOps engineer [Scott Kausler](https://github.com/scott-kausler) who shared the details of their onboarding journey, lessons learned, and insights for other Backstage adopters._**\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Templates or the cluster didn\'t happen\\n\\nWhile mid-activation on a new cloud-based DevOps Kubernetes platform, Scott\'s team received early feedback that it was difficult to onboard teams onto this platform due to the breadth of requirements and new tools developers needed \u2014 from dependency management tools (such as Gradle, Conan, and Conda) to Docker/Kubernetes, Helm/FluxCD, and Vault. Not only were CTC developers required to learn new systems to build, package, and deploy their apps, in several cases even the code needed to be changed. There were also significant modifications required to existing tools such as Jenkins.\\n\\nScott\'s team quickly recognized that this friction could lead to lower adoption and longer onboarding times to the new platform. So he started investigating solutions that would allow him to templatize these new services and create turnkey onboarding with less reference knowledge required.\\n\\nAfter exploring several service routes from managed to in-house/owned, CTC opted to use Backstage \u2014 already in POC for use of the [Software Catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/) \u2014 due to the [Software Templates](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/) plugin form-based input, UI/json-schema-form abilities, and its extensibility. Scott\'s team felt Backstage provided the most sustainable solution for growth amongst the multiple developer portal and templation options vetted and would help bridge the gap between UI-driven deployment and GitOps.\\n\\n## Early wins on documentation and onboarding\\n\\nThe CTC DevOps team created a small special interest group to champion the developer portal build and quickly delved into the big issues impacting their developer experience. From there, the team began creating tasks and templates within Backstage.\\n\\nTo start, Scott worked with end-user teams outside DevOps early in the process of documenting migration to the new DevOps Kubernetes platform services. When Scott wrote the onboarding documentation, he made it a point to pair with a developer on another team that would be using it. This approach provided him with a quality sounding board, great instantaneous feedback, and a sort of \\"beta developer\\" to test V1 documentation clarity., A few weeks later, another colleague on the same end-user team followed the documentation and she didn\'t reach out to Scott at all.\\n\\nAfter this early win, the team was ready for broad distribution. Partnering with the senior leadership team, Scott\'s team began onboarding teams to the new DevOps Kubernetes platform using the templates his team created in Backstage. At CTC, their Backstage instance is set up to automatically scan for deployments in Kubernetes; so if you\'re in Kubernetes, you\'re onboarded to Backstage.\\n\\n\\"Backstage made onboarding [to the new DevOps platform] not scary,\\"\\" Scott said. \\"Because now \u2014 all of a sudden \u2014 you have this recipe for how to do it, you don\'t have to jump through these hoops, the templates are there and ready for you. You choose what you want based on these templates we have available, and you\'re off and running on your own.\\"\\"\\n\\nScott\'s team monitored progress against their onboarding goals partially by how often the DevOps team was getting pinged for support and found that it has made support smoother. They can easily refer people to templates and repo standards instead of making them create something ad hoc.\\n\\n\\"It\'s really been cool seeing how that progressed. I even have a few teams that didn\'t talk to DevOps at all. They used a [template] and they have a service ready. We were actually pretty excited about that, because that means now we have a scalable tool able to onboard others onto our platform.\\"\\" said Scott.\\n\\nAnother exciting win for CTC was template additions generated outside the initial toolkit, which has eased the burden substantially for the DevOps team. They were able to create new templates to deploy against best practices such as a template for creating a brand-new Terraform module and Git repo or \u2014 Scott\'s favorite \u2014 \u200B\u200Ba template that creates a Java repository along with Jenkins jobs for CI and the Flux CD config for deployment.\\n\\n\\"The template builds and auto-deploys a Docker image, so if you make a change to your mainline branch, then it will automatically build a new Docker image and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster.\\"\\" Scott said. \\"So within basically 10 minutes of you filling out a form, you actually have something deployed out to a Kubernetes cluster.\\"\\"\\n\\nThis process eased flows for both end-user devs and DevOps teams overall.\\n\\n## Measuring Backstage impact at CTC\\n\\nTo calculate the impact of Backstage, Scott began with reviewing template types and assigning a weighted value to each based upon their perceived workload.\\n\\nAt CTC, some templates create a repo, some templates create a repo with some code, some templates even go as far as creating a repo with code and all the prerequisites to deploy to Flux and Jenkins jobs. To be conservative, the highest weight Scott assigned to a template would be saving three days of developer time. Even with that conservative estimate, the figure came out to be a savings of 18 months in developer effort since Backstage was deployed ten months ago.\\n\\nFor CTC, the journey with Backstage has just begun. They\'re now looking to drive more Catalog adoption and determine what custom plugins they need to build to better support their workflows.\\n\\n## The power of partnership (and good docs!)\\n\\nWhen asked about advice he has for other Backstage adopters, Scott talked about the DevOps team\'s comms strategy and ensuring end-user developers had pathways to provide feedback. In addition to the focus on templates for the new services, having both a dedicated Slack channel and open-door communication with the DevOps team helped reduce onboarding friction to the DevOps Kubernetes platform.\\n\\nOutside of that, he believes the approach to documentation is paramount. \\"Write your documentation from the perspective of, \'Hey, you have this task assigned to you to write a template, here are the exact steps you have to follow.\'\\"\\" Scott said. \\"Think of it as a recipe. Removing your familiarity bias will help make this tool more useful for less familiar teams.\\"\\"\\n\\nFinally, don\'t be afraid to step outside the core use cases when it comes to the Backstage framework and finding solutions to meet your needs.\\n\\n\\"Backstage gives you a lot of really easy to use features right out of the box. And one of the great things about open source is you can look at the code and see exactly what the behavior is and work within that behavior. But we\'ve also developed our own processes for custom tasks because \u2014 at the end of the day \u2014 our platform has some very custom aspects to it.\\"\\" Scott said.\\n\\nInterested in more stories from Backstage adopters?

We\'ve been at the Backstage party since the beginning helping companies adopt and extend Backstage to fit the needs of their unique ecosystems.\\n\\nThrough our experience, we\'ve uncovered five common traits of organizations that have improved developer experience through successful Backstage implementation and adoption. In this blog, we\'ll dive into these traits with some thoughts on how you can follow their blueprint.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## **1) They take a product-centric approach**\\n\\nThe biggest factor for successful adopters of Backstage is their approach. There is a high correlation of success within organizations that approach building a developer portal like they\'re building a product. Some organizations will jump straight into solutioning instead of taking their time to identify what the problems are, how they affect users, and how those issues can be addressed.\\n\\nThe team building out Backstage should assess or work from existing insights on the core challenges that developers are facing in their organization \u2014 both qualitative and quantitative data counts here \u2014 and connect those issues to a product roadmap with initial use cases and adoption milestones marked. By doing their research in advance, successful orgs have a clear vision of what they want to accomplish with their Backstage instance. They know exactly what goals need to be met and have pressure-tested potential issues and barriers.\\n\\nIf you\'ve already started your Backstage adoption journey but haven\'t mapped a Product Requirements Document (or PRD), don\'t panic! There is always time to do the foundational knowledge-building necessary to deploy something successful.\\n\\n## **2) They tie Backstage to a larger platform journey**\\n\\nPlatform engineering has emerged in response to the growing complexity of cloud-native software architecture. Backstage has a huge role to play in implementing a platform strategy but its part of a larger story. Having buy-in from both higher ups and the teams tasked with platform goals is an essential step in successful Backstage adoption. Without the support at the top, it can be difficult to implement platforming as a priority within your organization.\\n\\nAnd by \\"the top\\", we don\'t necessarily mean your CTO needs to rubber stamp your Backstage POC. But it\'s important that higher-level Platform goals have been set among VPs and directors with the understanding that a well-constructed developer portal can be the catalyst to achieving not only better developer experience but broader cultural shifts.\\n\\nHaving this kind of executive buy-in means more than just getting stakeholders on board with a portal build or clearing pathways towards Backstage adoption; it also means ensuring they understand the realities of your organization\'s journey.\\n\\n## **3) They prioritize developer experience**\\n\\nHaving a dedicated developer experience or DevOps team tasked not only with building out a Backstage instance \u2014 but with leading adoption \u2014 is another big factor to success.\\n\\nCompeting platforms are very common at big companies, with many teams doing different things or serving different parts of a business. But developer experience teams usually have a very clear mandate and are often one of the only commonalities between these competing teams. This team should have the bandwidth available to oversee the adoption process from start to finish, and partner with the right folks (research, design, internal comms and marketing) to create an effective adoption plan tailored specifically for a company\'s needs.\\n\\nIf you don\'t have \u200Cestablished developer experience resources in place, then the questions the team leading the Backstage work needs to ask are \\"what are the common problems to be solved at a platform level?\\" and \\"once we\'ve proved our initial use cases, how are we internally evangelizing this amongst our competing teams?\\"\\n\\n## **4) They collaborate with other platform teams**\\n\\nA developer experience team can not single-handedly transform an organization\'s development structures, processes, and culture. It requires collaboration with teams responsible for other aspects of the platform. Successful adopters collaborate with other teams to bring them along on the journey of improving developer experience. They use Backstage as an opportunity to foster their inner-source contribution practice by allowing multiple platform teams to contribute plugins to their portal.\\n\\nThe developer experience team takes on the role of host in that collaborative process. They support other teams in integrating their features into the portal, provide guidance on best practices, and advocate for the needs of developers.\\n\\n## **5) They engage, learn, and grow with the community**\\n\\nOne of the key benefits of building a developer platform based off an open source framework is leveraging the contributions and best practices from the community. The Backstage community is the largest gathering of developer experience practitioners in the world. There are now [thousands of adopters](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/63aa3a65ec05f638ba76c06878d6635194620b34/ADOPTERS.md#L4) with a wealth of experience and best practices to learn from \u2014 and they are excited to share!\\n\\nBy participating in the community, developer experience leaders can learn from their peers at other companies about strategies that work and can keep up with the latest features of the ever-evolving Backstage platform. They\'re aware of what solutions exist within the open source framework and plugin marketplace as well as what they may need to build in-house.\\n\\nIn short, successful Backstage adopters engage within the Backstage community and their peer group to find solutions that fit their common challenges as well as their unique needs."},{"id":"/2023/07/08/stash-adopter-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/08/stash-adopter-post","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-08-stash-adopter-post.mdx","title":"Adopter Spotlight: How Stash simplified monitoring, ownership and true app health with microservices","description":"backstage header","date":"2023-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":13.44,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Taylor Webber, Staff Engineer, Stash","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Adopter Spotlight: How Stash simplified monitoring, ownership and true app health with microservices","author":"Taylor Webber, Staff Engineer, Stash"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Five common traits of successful Backstage adopters","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/28/frontside-adopter-post"},"nextItem":{"title":"Switching out the Software Templates Sandbox","permalink":"/blog/2023/06/21/switching-out-sandbox"}},"content":"![backstage header](assets/2023-07-08/banner.png)\\n\\n**TL;DR**: Monitoring the health of a software application goes beyond surfacing API errors and customer-facing issues. It requires a comprehensive understanding of every facet of a service, including process metrics like DORA, as well as clear ownership of services and processes. By implementing Elevate as an internal developer portal, development teams now have better visibility of ownership in the distributed systems they work in. They also have the benefit of consolidated application health data and other metrics gained from the SaaS products they utilize everyday. This approach ensures a \u201Csingle pane of glass\u201D for application ownership and health so our teams can focus on building products and features that help our customers invest for a prosperous future.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nAt [Stash](https://www.stash.com), our mission is to give people the confidence to invest for a better life. Our app simplifies investing for the middle class who may be less experienced with traditional investing and retirement planning. Our customers trust us with their money, and with that, rely on us to provide a responsive and quality experience that works every time.\\n\\nIt isn\'t revolutionary to say that monitoring the health of a software application is critical for ensuring its reliability and performance in service of customers\' needs. However, in a distributed architecture like microservices, tracking ownership and monitoring application health across the system quickly becomes complex. The difficulties are further compounded when leveraging multiple SaaS products, which is common in modern development but specifically so for fintechs like Stash that integrate best-of-breed software in novel ways, as we do across our platform.\\n\\nWhat we found is that there are ways to make sense of these complex systems by tracking DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics for applications and leveraging SaaS products to create a central hub to understand the _true_ health of an application.\\n\\nIn this post, I\'ll walk you through Stash\'s journey to create Elevate, our Internal Developer Portal (IDP) based on the open source [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) framework. Our portal increased visibility of application health metrics, prioritized cloud cost insights, and reduced the context switching required for teams to understand service ownership and the components that make up the entirety of Stash\'s world-class application systems.\\n\\nElevate enables effective monitoring, streamlined incident response, improved overall application health, and most importantly, team health.\\n\\n# Setting the monitoring/DORA scene\\n\\nIt seems counterintuitive, but trying to solve the problem of monitoring and tracking ownership with a traditional centralized approach and more SaaS monitoring tools will likely not solve the problem.\\n\\nTraditional centralized monitoring approaches may not suffice in a distributed architecture due to services that may act as pass-throughs or services that call many other services to aggregate data or tasks. In traditional monitoring, you will only see the error rates and request logging for individual services. That will only ever show you part of the puzzle as you\'ll still be unable to trace a request from a frontend application, through your many service layers to your data stores and back out.\\n\\nUtilizing multiple SaaS products for service monitoring and observability during development introduces additional complexity; each product may have its own dashboard and reporting tools. These implementation differences can make it difficult to consolidate and gain a holistic view of the application\'s health.\\n\\nPicking the right tool for the job can make developing quality products at speed and scale easier, but what we\'ve learned is that utilizing each tool\'s context for application health as a piece of the puzzle has exponentially impacted our team\'s effectiveness.\\n\\nThe team at Stash took an approach of enhanced monitoring which required introducing request tracing for services that a team owns (and the entire org) to get the full picture. We worked to distribute monitoring **_across_** services, capturing both customer-facing issues and internal process metrics that focus on service quality.\\n\\nWe also took a hard look at our health metrics. Some attributes of healthy applications are high availability, HTTP 500 errors are minimal, CPU and memory usage are sustainable, and the \u201C/health\u201D endpoint returns the health of the application. However, to gain insights into the true health of an application and the teams supporting it, tracking DORA metrics is essential.\\n\\nWe took four key DORA metrics \u2014 deployment frequency, lead time for changes, mean time to restore, and change failure rate \u2014 to process aspects of services and provide a comprehensive understanding of an application\'s overall health as well as the health of our team and organization.\\n\\n# Understanding complex systems at Stash with Backstage\\n\\nAt Stash, we use a multitude of SaaS tools during the software development process, some of which provide varying degrees of built-in service catalogs. With many sources of truth and a lack of ability to combine data from multiple sources (eg. FireHydrant incident response with DataDog or DataDog Real User Monitoring data in PagerDuty, etc.) it was challenging to get a holistic view of the whole system..\\n\\nAdditionally, as we created more and more microservices, it became challenging to determine ownership for each service. Microservice owners were finding it increasingly difficult to keep track of their various consumers to assure that contracts were being maintained as new changes were introduced. Ownership clarity was **_crucial_** to our goals for effective monitoring, issue resolution, and maintaining accountability.\\n\\nTo consolidate application health data, simplify support and clarify ownership for those on development teams as well as for those in non-engineering roles, we implemented an instance of Backstage as an internal service catalog we call Elevate.\\n\\nUtilizing Backstage as a framework, Elevate aims to improve quality and domain expertise for all things code and process at Stash. The key to accomplishing this goal is to leverage the processes and integrations we already use at Stash, but centralize and surface the data in a way that is digestible for engineers and non-engineers alike.\\n\\nFor the benefit of a self-managed internal service catalog to outweigh the change in processes and the cost of the catalog\'s infrastructure, it had to be easy to adopt and have an enlightening effect on teams.\\n\\n## Ownership visibility\\n\\nElevate acts as a centralized hub for registering services, documenting ownership information, and establishing clear accountability. It provides a holistic view of distributed systems and the shared modules and libraries they use by making it easier to track ownership and ensure effective communication and collaboration.\\n\\nThe Backstage [Software Catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/) model allows service-level tracking, as well as dashboards for Groups (teams or squads), Systems (business units or focus areas), Domains (organization units) or even company wide.\\n\\n### Easy adoption and catalog usage\\n\\nThe Backstage open source plugins provide the nuts and bolts for our internal service catalog functionality. Backstage\'s community plugins assist with the basics of catalog management. They also allow for dynamically changing the type content based on which entry is being viewed in the catalog (library, service, API, team, etc.). Each view can be custom-tailored with the information for that type of entry, which allows for shared libraries to have an overview page focused on getting engineers to documentation; while the overview page for a deployed service can focus on the current incident status and on-call information as the most important thing. The plugin for searching allows for easy discovery of items or documentation throughout the catalog.\\n\\n###### Example catalog-info.yaml file to add service to Elevate\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1\\nkind: Component\\nmetadata:\\n  name: your-service\\n  description: Awesome service for awesome things\\n  annotations:\\n    backstage.io/kubernetes-namespace: your-service\\n    datadoghq.com/site: datadoghq.com\\n    datadoghq.com/dashboard-url: https://p.datadoghq.com/some-dashbaord\\n    firehydrant.com/service-name: your-service\\n    jira/project-key: your-jira-project\\n    github.com/project-slug: \'your-org/your-service\'\\n    pagerduty.com/service-id: your-pagerduty-service-id\\n  links:\\n    - title: Team Slack Channel\\n      url: https://your-company.slack.com/archives/your-slack-channel-id\\n      type: Slack\\n      icon: chat\\n    - title: Getting started\\n      url: https://github.com/your-org/your-service/blob/main/README.md\\n      type: Readme\\n      icon: github\\n    - title: Confluence\\n      url: https://your-company.atlassian.net/your-docs-page-url\\n      type: Confluence\\n      icon: docs\\nspec:\\n  type: service\\n  lifecycle: production\\n  owner: your-team\\n  system: your-business-unit\\n```\\n\\n### Connecting to subject matter experts\\n\\nElevate leverages the CODEOWNERS integration to establish expertise of specific codebases within services and ensure accountability and clarity within the development teams. Codespace ownership is typically defined with required reviewers by code owners and admins that provide additional support, but the CODEOWNERS plugin allows for clarity into who the subject matter expert of the codebase is, not just the administrative owner. The plugin also displays recent changes that have been merged into the codebase, including the authors and approvers of the changes and other valuable metadata.\\n\\nThis improved clarity into contributors and recent contributions can prevent developers and managers from playing telephone when effective communication is crucial to fixing a bug or resolving an incident.\\n\\n![service code owners](assets/2023-07-08/image5.png)\\n\\n![recent changes](assets/2023-07-08/image3.png)\\n\\n_CODEOWNER cards for service ownership and recent changes that appear on a service\'s overview page._\\n\\n## Integration with SaaS products\\n\\nBackstage offers a catalog of integrations with many popular SaaS products. With Elevate, we\'ve integrated plugins for monitoring infrastructure and user experience, visualizing process backlog and bottlenecks, as well as giving insights into data that teams have not yet been able to see for services they support. These integrations allow for seamless data collection and aggregation, transforming Elevate into the centralized hub for application and team health data.\\n\\nThe key to making your service catalog scalable is to ensure you aren\'t requiring the duplication of data away from its source; Elevate utilizes dashboards and charts to view the data stored in the remote sources. When aggregating DORA metrics we are able to leverage our SaaS tools API within Elevate\'s service layer to pull data and transform it for our custom dashboards.\\n\\n### Visible cohesive monitoring\\n\\nAt Stash, we collect performance metrics, resource utilization, and proactive alerts with DataDog and Sentry; these tools can also monitor and track API errors and customer-facing issues that would normally go undetected. To deliver the best possible experience for Stash\'s customers, engineers need to be able to easily monitor errors on customer devices to solve issues before they are reported.\\n\\nSentry\'s plugin easily surfaces uncaught errors within services. DataDog\'s plugin allows for plug-and-play visualizations of charts or graphs to help support services, teams and beyond. Elevate integrates these insights to monitor the overall health of the application.\\n\\n### Centralized incident management\\n\\nPagerDuty has been Stash\'s standard for on-call activities and paging while FireHydrant has more recently been adopted as a part of a more comprehensive incident management process. Together, we use these incident management platforms to establish incident response workflows and communication channels dedicated to each service.\\n\\nPagerDuty\'s plugin allows for quick reference to the individual who is actively on-call for a service while FireHydrant\'s plugin lets you track open incidents that may be impacting a service and even trigger new incidents directly from within the service overview page in Elevate. Integrating these plugins allows Elevate to serve as a centralized location for the incident management process, helping our engineers quickly gather the necessary context of an issue and drive faster resolution.\\n\\n![active incidents](assets/2023-07-08/image1.png)\\n\\n![pager duty](assets/2023-07-08/image8.png)\\n\\n_FireHydrant and PagerDuty cards that appear on a service\'s overview page._\\n\\n## Infrastructure cost insights across all systems\\n\\nIt\'s difficult for teams to be more efficient with their infrastructure costs if they are unable to see the problem areas for the services they support, as well as references for effective resource management to model after. The AWS Cost Insights plugin allows Elevate to monitor cost-related metrics and ensure efficient resource allocation and budgeting.\\n\\nDue to the dynamic nature of how different companies may want to aggregate their cost data, the plugin is mostly frontend visualizations for displaying costs over time with drop-downs for filtering and grouping. In Elevate, we created a custom backend plugin to pull our costs data from AWS and group it properly for presentation to the visualizations.\\n\\nWhen we surface this data with the backend layer in Elevate, the frontend is able to surface our AWS cost data to people who previously didn\'t have access or who found it too difficult to use the more complex AWS Cost Explorer.\\n\\nIn addition to these people now having access to AWS cost data, those with access now get to visualize our spend by AWS product and Stash service. These visualizations are available when looking at a single service, a team or business unit, and organization-wide.\\n\\n![aws breakdown](assets/2023-07-08/image6.png)\\n\\n_Breakdown of costs per AWS product for a service._\\n\\n![aws breakdown by project](assets/2023-07-08/image9.png)\\n\\n_Breakdown of total costs per service owned by a Team or Business Unit._\\n\\n![aws breakdown for org](assets/2023-07-08/image4.png)\\n\\n_Breakdown of total costs per service across the organization._\\n\\nFor those that aren\'t regularly in AWS Cost Explorer, a benefit of implementing these visualizations is being able to easily see where we have some room for improvement when it comes to tagging our AWS resources. The company-wide breakdown shows all resources, whereas the sub-views rely on resource tagging for service name and team name, so discrepancies may arise which will help you close any gaps in tagging you may have. If resources are not properly tagged, reducing and managing your infrastructure costs will be more time consuming than necessary and much less effective.\\n\\n## Service, team and organizational health\\n\\nAs mentioned above, gathering DORA metrics provides important insight into the health of applications and teams, but until we built Elevate, we didn\'t have a hub at Stash to aggregate and present that data in an easily digestible manner.\\n\\nElevate\'s initial DORA metrics implementation reaches out to the source(s) of truth for each metric and groups and surfaces that in a manner similar to the AWS Cost Insights implementation.\\n\\n**Deployment Frequency** from DataDog \u201Cdeployment\u201D indicator for each service\\n\\n**Lead Time for Changes** from GitHub for each repo using commit sha\'s and releases\\n\\n**Mean Time to Restore** from FireHydrant using their MTTR API for each service\\n\\n**Change Failure Rate** from DataDog and FireHydrant for each service\\n\\nElevate implemented the above data sources for our DORA metrics MVP as those have been determined as our best practices for where that information should be tracked, for now.\\n\\n![dora metrics](assets/2023-07-08/image10.png)\\n\\n_DORA metrics that display on the overview page for each service._\\n\\nSoftware development has an ever-changing SaaS landscape, so what serves as a best practice today, may not be in a week, a month or a year from now. The tools we use to facilitate a task or automate processes may change, but the metrics we want to track (DORA and others) are much more stable. Surfacing data in easily consumable views within Elevate has decoupled the tool we use to accomplish a task from where we monitor the health of our system and how that tool assists.\\n\\n![dora metrics typescript interface](assets/2023-07-08/image7.png)\\n\\n_An abstracted service layer that is agnostic of data source(s) allows for a stable integration for our frontend dashboards._\\n\\n![backend interface](assets/2023-07-08/image2.png)\\n\\n_Separate backend services by metric allow for easy updating for additional or new data sources in the future._\\n\\n# tl;dr\\n\\nMonitoring the health of a software application goes beyond surfacing API errors and customer-facing issues. It requires a comprehensive understanding of every facet of a service, including process metrics like DORA, as well as clear ownership of services and processes. By implementing Elevate as an internal developer portal, development teams now have better visibility of ownership in the distributed systems they work in. They also have the benefit of consolidated application health data and other metrics gained from the SaaS products they utilize everyday.

The [Backstage Threat Model](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model/) treats the code provided by the template language as untrusted, so adopters need a safe environment \u2013 a sandbox \u2013 to execute the JavaScript in.\\nUp until the latest Backstage release, that sandbox was `vm2`. Now, the project is instead using `isolated-vm` as the sandbox to execute this JavaScript in.\\n\\n## Why the change?\\n\\nYou might have seen over the last few months [some advisories and CVEs](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories) that were found in the original [`vm2`](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2) sandbox that we were using.\\nBoth the `vm2` maintainers and the Backstage maintainers have been quick at releasing new versions of the sandbox and the Software Templates backend plugin, respectively, to protect their users.\\n\\nWe were recently made aware of another sandbox escape through our HackerOne BugBounty program, with a Proof of Concept using a Software Template.\\nThe maintainers of the `vm2` project have also been notified. We currently cannot find a simple solution to stop the latest escape. So, In the interest of moving quickly to protect the security of our end-users, we\'re moving away from that `vm2` and moving towards [`isolated-vm`](https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm) instead.\\n\\n`vm2` has been one of the most popular sandboxes to-date, and we want to thank the `vm2` maintainers for the recent sandbox escape fixes and getting those shipped as fast as possible.\\n\\n## What does this mean for Backstage?\\n\\n`isolated-vm` uses a quite different implementation and security model compared to `vm2`.\\n\\nIt is a native dependency and executes code in a `v8` engine so-called `isolate` instead. This means that by design, it does not have any access to neither the node runtime nor any frameworks on top of `v8`, which is precisely what we want to ensure in our sandbox.\\n\\nThis method of sandboxing is much more secure than how the `vm2` sandbox functions, and less prone to escapes.\\n\\nWhile we can rest assured that this is a highly secure sandbox, the native dependency might mean there\'s a little more burden on adopters to install this dependency properly and have the right libraries set up.\\nThis native dependency must be built upon installation, on the exact architecture that it executes on.\\n\\nFor those who compile and run Backstage on stripped-down environments, you will want to ensure that you have the build basics present, e.g. `build-essential` or similar corresponding to your operating system of choice.\\nThe `isolated-vm` repo has [some further information](https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm#requirements) about the build environment requirements.\\n\\nWith all that said, we think this tradeoff is worth the effort to ensure better security.\\n\\n## What do you need to do?\\n\\nThis change comes with the v1.15.0 release of Backstage that was released yesterday, so please make sure you are upgraded to the latest version of Backstage to keep your sandbox environments secure.\\n\\nFor more guidance on how to upgrade, check out the documentation for [keeping Backstage updated](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/keeping-backstage-updated).\\n\\nIf you have any further questions you can either reach out to us in the [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673), or in the [office hours](https://info.backstage.spotify.com/office-hours)."},{"id":"/2023/05/06/backstage-deploy-alpha","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/05/06/backstage-deploy-alpha","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-06-backstage-deploy-alpha.mdx","title":"Welcome: Backstage Deploy CLI (Alpha)","description":"This blog post is co-authored by Emma White (@ewhite1997), Spotify.","date":"2023-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":4.07,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Djamaile Rahamat, Spotify","url":"https://github.com/djamaile","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15789670?v=4","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Welcome: Backstage Deploy CLI (Alpha)","author":"Djamaile Rahamat, Spotify","authorURL":"https://github.com/djamaile","authorImageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15789670?v=4"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Switching out the Software Templates Sandbox","permalink":"/blog/2023/06/21/switching-out-sandbox"},"nextItem":{"title":"ICYMI: KubeCon EU 2023","permalink":"/blog/2023/04/26/kubecon-eu-2023"}},"content":"_This blog post is co-authored by Emma White ([@ewhite1997](https://github.com/ewhite1997)), Spotify._\\n\\n![Backstage Deploy banner](assets/2023-05-06/Welcome-Backstage-Deploy.png)\\n\\nTL;DR: Backstage released a new CLI earlier this year as part of a [new Backstage project](https://github.com/backstage/backstage-deploy). This new capability allows early adopters to deploy their Backstage proof of concept faster than before. In this blog, you\u2019ll learn a little bit more about the Deploy CLI and how you can get started with it.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Why Backstage Deploy\\n\\nWe\u2019ve heard from Backstage adopters that before reaching widespread adoption at their organizations, teams test out a Backstage proof of concept (POC). To create the POC, teams scaffold an instance, set up the catalog, and change the UI to suit their company\u2019s branding. Once these milestones are completed, there\'s just one last step before showing off the awesomeness of a Backstage POC internally... deploying the Backstage POC from a local machine to the cloud. This final step often introduces a lot of questions that attempt to determine the easiest and fastest way to do that.\\n\\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re at this last step: your POC is ready for deployment, but you have some lingering questions.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n- What Dockerfile should you use?\\n- Should the POC be deployed on Kubernetes?\\n- How do you deploy the POC on my cloud provider?\\n\\nTo address these questions and reduce friction from deploying a POC, we built a [new CLI](https://github.com/backstage/backstage-deploy). The CLI is simply called `deploy` and is invocable with `npx`. With this new CLI, you can generate a Dockerfile and deploy a Backstage instance onto a preferred cloud provider. While the package\u2019s infrastructure is built to support all cloud providers, currently the CLI only offers an AWS implementation. In the future, we plan to add additional cloud providers to the package and [welcome any contributions](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/6996b3338d678efc03307112524060e9dc2ad769/CONTRIBUTING.md) extending the suite of cloud provider implementations!\\n\\n**So, what about Kubernetes?** Since the CLI is designed specifically for the POC phase, we believe that Kubernetes isn\u2019t the right fit \u2013 as Kubernetes is better suited for production workloads. So, we explored lightweight, container-based solutions, and landed on [Amazon Lightsail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/index.html) as a hosting service for the POC.\\nAmazon Lightsail supports [lightweight container](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-container-services) deployments [at a low cost](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/), and has a [free trial for new users](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/?loc=ft#AWS_Free_Tier)! Given Lightsail\u2019s ease of use and affordability, we recommend using Lightsail over Kubernetes to test out your Backstage POC.\\n\\nWith the Dockerfile and Kubernetes questions answered, we just have to address how to actually deploy the POC. And that is where the new CLI comes in.\\n\\n## Get started with Deploy CLI\\n\\nIt\'s now time to put the Deploy CLI into action and deploy a Backstage POC. The following steps guide you through the deployment process.\\n\\nDeploy CLI makes use of [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/) which is an infrastructure-as-code tool that helps provision resources in the cloud. Before you get started, ensure you have the [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/cli/) and [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed on your local machine.\\n\\nYou can find the step-by-step installation documentation for Pulumi under the [Deployment section](https://backstage.io/docs/deployment/backstage-deploy/aws-lightsail).\\n\\nBut we summarize the steps to deploy your POC here. You can invoke the CLI you can use the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npx backstage-deploy aws --create-dockerfile\\nStarting Pulumi\\nsuccessfully initialized stack\\ninstalling aws plugin...\\nplugins installed\\nsetting up config\\nrefreshing stack...\\nRefreshing (backstage):\\n\\nInstance will live at:\\nhttps://backstage-container-service.xxx.us-east-1.cs.amazonlightsail.com/\\n```\\n\\nOnce you kick off the command it will create a Dockerfile for you in the root and Pulumi will start provisioning resources in AWS.\\nPulumi will then create a container based deployment in Amazon Lightsail.\\n\\nAfter you\u2019re done with the POC, it\u2019s easy to delete the AWS resources you provisioned and save you costs within AWS. You can do so with the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npx backstage-deploy aws --destroy\\n```\\n\\n## Looking ahead\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier in this blog, we released the Backstage Deploy CLI with an AWS implementation only.

In case you missed it, here\u2019s a quick recap:\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Backstage Project Meeting\\n\\n![A packed room for the Backstage project meeting](assets/2023-04-26/IMG_2522.png)\\n\\nOn Tuesday the Backstage maintainers hosted a jam-packed project meeting. The community welcomed many teams and individuals that were early in their Backstage journey, either actively adopting, preparing for the POC phase, or learning about the capabilities of Backstage. Many of the newcomers were eager to learn about how Backstage could help streamline their development workflows and improve developer productivity. During the project meeting, the maintainers covered a \u201Cday in the life\u201D of a core maintainer, walked through spinning up a new instance of Backstage in a live demo, and opened it up to questions from the community. It\u2019s super exciting to see so much growing interest in Backstage and all of the ways adopters are adapting it to their needs.\\n\\n## State of Backstage in 2023\\n\\n![Patrik and Ben onstage for the State of Backstage talk](assets/2023-04-26/IMG_0120.png)\\n\\nCore maintainers [Ben Lambert](https://github.com/benjdlambert) and [Patrik Oldsberg](https://github.com/Rugvip) took center stage on Wednesday for the Backstage Maintainer Track: State of Backstage in 2023 talk. Backstage has officially hit over 1,000 adopters and 1,000 contributors \u2013 so it\u2019s apt timing to modernize the governance model for the project. Taking pointers from the [CNCF Contributor Ladder Governance Template](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/templates/), a new [Backstage Governance Model](https://github.com/backstage/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) is now in effect! Patrik walked us through the new ladder model which introduces a number of changes, one being the addition of [project area maintainers](https://github.com/backstage/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#project-area-maintainer). This role lets members of the community take increased ownership over a specific area of interest, like Catalog, Discoverability, TechDocs, Helm Charts, and Kubernetes. New project areas that will be added include Permissions and Software Templates. New project areas can be proposed by nominating a project area maintainer for the area. The new model also adds an organization member role for contributors who want to take a more active role in the Backstage community. You can open an issue to become an organization member [here](https://github.com/backstage/community/issues/new/choose).\\n\\n![Contributor ladder](assets/2023-04-26/contributor_ladder.png)\\n\\nBen and Patrik also covered new capabilities for Software Templates and framework updates. Lots of exciting new features are planned for Software Templates including a new UI, async validation for CustomFieldExtensions, and embedded workflows. Lastly, the maintainers also announced a new focus on declarative integration \u2013 permitting plugin installation without TypeScript. Development is still early, but we can\u2019t wait to see this in action!\\n\\n## Other KubeCon excitement!\\n\\nThroughout the week, we also heard success stories of adopters, like AppsFlyer\u2019s talk, \u201CHow We Migrated Over 1000 Services to Backstage Using GitOps and Survived to Talk About It!\u201D AppsFlyer has over 1,000 services and processes over 200 billion events per day \u2013 so migrating to Backstage as their service catalog platform was no small feat. As part of their migration, they also integrated GitOps and Terraform into their Backstage instance. Many attendees found interest in these case studies where you could see the adoption and POC process directly from other adopters. It was exciting to see firsthand how teams can extend Backstage to fit their needs on the fly.\\n\\nWe were thrilled to see so much excitement and interest brewing around Backstage this year! If you missed it, you can catch up as soon as more talks are added to the [CNCF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@cncf/featured). We can\u2019t wait to catch up with you all again soon at KubeCon North America in Chicago."},{"id":"/2023/03/15/backstage-turns-3","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/03/15/backstage-turns-3","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-15-backstage-turns-3.mdx","title":"Backstage Turns Three!","description":"backstage turns 3 header image","date":"2023-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":5.83,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ben Lambert","url":"https://github.com/benjdlambert","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3645856?v=4","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Backstage Turns Three!","author":"Ben Lambert","authorURL":"https://github.com/benjdlambert","authorImageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3645856?v=4"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"ICYMI: KubeCon EU 2023","permalink":"/blog/2023/04/26/kubecon-eu-2023"},"nextItem":{"title":"Backstage Backend System Alpha","permalink":"/blog/2023/02/15/backend-system-alpha"}},"content":"![backstage turns 3 header image](assets/2023-03-15/birthday.gif)\\n\\n**TL;DR** Spotify released Backstage into open source three years ago today. Since then, the community has grown by leaps and bounds to stretch across the globe (and the Discord server!). Now that Backstage is a threenager, the growing pains are real. So, on this birthday, we want to cover our collective efforts to make it easier to adopt and contribute to Backstage.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## They grow up so fast, don\u2019t they?\\n\\nHappy birthday, Backstage! Three years ago, Spotify released its homegrown developer portal into the wild after a small team collaborated on an internal Hack Week project. We\u2019d had a lot of conversations with companies looking to build out something similar to what we\u2019d been running for years, so our Hack Week sprint started as an experiment to see if the Backstage core plugins could be valuable in open source.\\n\\nIt\'s clich\xe9 at this point \u2014 because we\u2019ve said it a million times \u2014\xa0but no one could have predicted what came next.\\n\\nIn three short years, Backstage has grown to a Cloud Native Computing Foundation Incubating project, with more than 900 adopters and 1000+ contributors worldwide. Companies like CVS Health, Siemens, LinkedIn, REI, Vodafone, and Lego are building out their own developer portals from the Backstage framework and bringing their learnings to the project.\\n\\nA few more stats we love to see (mainly coming from the [project repo](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)):\\n\\n- 3k+ project forks\\n- 38k+ commits\\n- 12k+ PRs\\n- 15k+ total contributions\\n- 21k+ stars on GitHub\\n- 9k+ Discord members\\n- 100+ open source plugins in the [plugin marketplace](https://backstage.io/plugins)\\n\\nBut, without a doubt, the best thing about the Backstage project is the people in this community. People who are curious, collaborative, and excited to share knowledge. People who\u2019ll sift through Discord at all hours to answer questions and support one another. People who come from all over the world but share a common trait: being passionate about enabling developers to do their best work.\\n\\nDon\u2019t take our word for it! Take a look at this birthday video we put together with a few community members.\\n\\n<div\\n  style={{\\n    position: \'relative\',\\n    overflow: \'hidden\',\\n    width: \'100%\',\\n    paddingTop: \'56.25%\',\\n  }}\\n>\\n  <iframe\\n    style={{\\n      position: \'absolute\',\\n      top: 0,\\n      left: 0,\\n      right: 0,\\n      bottom: 0,\\n      width: \'100%\',\\n      height: \'100%\',\\n    }}\\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rllOa_MfEWw\\"\\n    frameBorder=\\"0\\"\\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\"\\n    allowFullScreen\\n  ></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n## The growing pains are real\\n\\nBut it\'s not all sunshine and roses in Backstage-land. If Year 1 was about getting this community going and Year 2 was focused on maturing the platform, then Year 3 needs to address some of the inevitable growing pains a project undergoes as it gains ground.\\n\\nWe hear two things pretty consistently from the community:\\n\\n- **Backstage is a steep learning curve:** Over the past three years, the project has grown in scope and breadth which can translate to complexity. This is especially true for newcomers looking to get their arms wrapped around the key concepts.\\n- **Backstage has barriers to adoption:** Backstage adopters tell us driving widespread adoption of their developer portal remains the biggest challenge they face. Adoption barriers can be technical but are often cultural.\\n\\nThe maintainers and some of our most involved community members are actively tackling how we can make the Backstage onboarding process easier for contributors. There are also lots of ways the project could better support adopters on that journey and make adoption faster and smoother.\\n\\nWe\u2019re looking at everything from cleaning up documentation to opinionated catalog ingestors being discussed in both the Catalog and Adoption monthly SIGs (running meeting notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xg57CDfX2R5jTGbbWANzifm2szEb664kuTwfEEvKgZU/) and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zeYSzXYgh897bxPQmwy2btOwCFlEjlUDLf00riySLRc)). A few priorities that we\u2019ve already mapped out:\\n\\n- Make it easier to install, customize, and maintain Backstage\\n- Provide Golden Paths for adoption\\n- Improve the experience and the content on [backstage.io](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage)\\n\\nBecause there are now so many mature adopters \u2014 Spotify included \u2014 there\u2019s so much knowledge on how to create a roadmap for adoption and use cases, how to roll out your developer portal to your teams and drive inner source contributions, how to measure and attribute developer productivity gains, etc.\\n\\nOur goal is to tap into the knowledge those adopters have gained and create more tangible resources for the entire community. But we can\u2019t do it without help. And that\u2019s where you come in!\\n\\n## Getting (more) involved\\n\\nWe\u2019re very grateful for the Backstage ride-or-dies: the contributors who show up to every community session, attend every SIG, and are always ready to jump in on any PR or issue.\\n\\nBut one of the areas where we think the project could greatly improve (and better address some of the growing pains I mentioned above!) is more active contribution \u2014 both the total number of people contributing and what they\u2019re contributing.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve already shared a bit on this but the maintainer team is starting to address this challenge by proposing the following three initiatives:\\n\\n- Introduce more steps in between first-time contributor and maintainer in the form of a contributor ladder (loosely based on the [CNCF Project Template](https://github.com/cncf/project-template/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER.md)).\\n- Change the ownership model, for example, divide the project up into several project areas, each covering particular parts of the project.\\n- Introduce a new process for large contributions in the form of Backstage Enhancement Proposals (BEPs).\\n\\nThese two RFCs on [Updated Backstage Governance](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/15317) and [Backstage Enhancement Proposals](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/15318) remain open so feel free to read and join the discussion! Watch this space as we\u2019ll share more on the go-forward governance and BEPs plan soon.\\n\\nBut if you\u2019re brand-new and just looking to get your feet wet, we\u2019ve also [compiled some small steps](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/getting-involved/) you can take to get involved:\\n\\n- Report (or squash) bugs: Look through the GitHub issues for [bugs](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/labels/bug), [good first issues](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [help wanted](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/labels/help%20wanted)\\n- Build or suggest a plugin: The Backstage project grows with every new plugin that gets added\\n- Add non-code contributions: We welcome things that help the community at large, but may not fit into the scope of the core project\\n- Write documentation or improve the website: The current documentation and project site are pretty limited. Better content helps a lot of those growing pains.\\n- Contribute to Storybook: Help us [create new components](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/labels/help%20wanted) or improve stories for the existing ones\\n- Submit feedback: The best way to send feedback is to file [an issue](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues) with as much detail as possible\\n- Add your company to ADOPTERS: Adding your company to [ADOPTERS](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md) really helps the project, you can do this by filling out this [adopter form](https://form.typeform.com/to/zcOaKikB)"},{"id":"/2023/02/15/backend-system-alpha","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/02/15/backend-system-alpha","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-15-backend-system-alpha.mdx","title":"Backstage Backend System Alpha","description":"backend system alpha header image","date":"2023-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":8.49,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Patrik Oldsberg","url":"https://github.com/Rugvip","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4984472?v=4","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Backstage Backend System Alpha","author":"Patrik Oldsberg","authorURL":"https://github.com/Rugvip","authorImageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4984472?v=4"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Backstage Turns Three!","permalink":"/blog/2023/03/15/backstage-turns-3"},"nextItem":{"title":"What\u2019s Ahead in 2023?","permalink":"/blog/2023/02/06/whats-ahead-in-2023"}},"content":"![backend system alpha header image](assets/2023-02-15/backend-system-alpha.gif)\\n\\n> UPDATE: The backend system is now released! See [the v1.18 release notes](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.18.0).\\n\\nFor the past year, the Backstage maintainer team has been spending time to give the [old Backstage backend system](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/backend-plugin) a much needed revamp. Our goal was not to build something completely new from scratch, but rather to solidify the existing foundations that have grown organically. We wanted to make plugin installation a lot simpler, while maintaining and even improving the ways in which you can customize your backend setups.\\n\\nWe\u2019re happy to announce that the [v1.11](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.11.0) release includes the public alpha of the [new Backstage backend system](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/)! The system has already been available to use for some time, as some of you have already found, but this alpha release marks the point where we are finally ready to encourage widespread adoption by plugin builders. We still don\u2019t recommend that you use this new system in your production setups just yet, more on that later.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## History of the Backstage backend system\\n\\nThe backend system that we all use today has grown very organically based on all the needs that have been discovered along the journey of the Backstage Open Source project. We started out with a very flexible system that was essentially just a collection of recommended patterns for plugins, along with a couple of common interfaces and utilities. This was largely due to the fact that before it was open sourced, the Backstage backend services at Spotify were all built on top of internal frameworks and practices that we couldn\u2019t bring with us. Back in 2020, we didn\u2019t have a lot of knowledge about what a good backend system for Backstage would look like, so we started off with a highly flexible foundation that would evolve organically over time.\\n\\nAs Backstage grew across all dimensions of adopter count, community size, code size, and capability, we saw the need to take a step back and reevaluate how Backstage backend plugins are built. About one year ago, the maintainers sat down and started to sketch what a new backend system could look like.\\n\\n## Designing the New System\\n\\nWhen we set out on this project, we had a few primary goals. First, we intended to introduce as few new concepts as possible. Our existing system already had a lot of different patterns, and ideally we wanted to only give those patterns names and make them part of the framework. Second, we wanted to keep the backend system recognizable to those familiar with the frontend system. The list of goals goes on, we had a lot of reasons to build this new system, these are a few more important ones:\\n\\n- Make it easier to create and maintain backend installations.\\n- Align how plugins provide points of customization and how those customizations are installed.\\n- Make it much easier to maintain plugins, in particular keeping the API stable.\\n- Improve the local development and testing experience.\\n\\nPrioritizing simplicity is often a guiding principle that we use for designs that span multiple ownership roles. We decide on which parts of the system that we think are the most important to have as simple as possible, or, viewed from the opposite end, where in the system we put necessary complexity. In this case, we optimized for keeping the backend setup as simple as possible, followed by modules and plugins, then libraries, and lastly the framework itself. What this guidance means in practice is that when there is complexity that needs to be added to implement a certain feature, we place as much of it as possible within the framework itself, then libraries, plugins and modules, and if absolutely needed, the backend setup.\\n\\nTo get the Backstage backend system to where we are today, we went through three major stages, starting with some very early high level experimentation. If you\u2019re a fan of Git archaeology, you can see some of our early ideas in [our experiments branch](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/fd3e6b67fef25a04789779700db4c37047d59d1b), as well as the [separate repository](https://github.com/backstage/backend-system-exploration) that we used to explore different ideas together with [Roadie](https://roadie.io/). The output of this work was all presented in an [RFC](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/11611) to gather feedback.\\n\\nA few months later as the RFC settled, we resumed work and followed up with an initial implementation. At this point there were still a lot of details in the design to figure out, especially as we started looking at how our existing plugins and services fit into this new system. We identified a lot of aspects that we inevitably didn\u2019t consider in the initial design, and started exploring technical solutions to those problems. There was a lot of zooming in and out, both implementing details and then stepping back and looking at how that affects the broader system and where to go next. This ended up being the most time consuming stage, and we spent several months iterating on this.\\n\\nWe wrapped up this work just before KubeCon NA 2022, with the full system implemented. The state of the system at this point was presented in our talk on the topic, which you can see just below. Except for a few API tweaks, this is what the system still looks like today.\\n\\n<iframe\\n  width=\\"780\\"\\n  height=\\"440\\"\\n  src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXF7uxrEBVY\\"\\n  frameBorder=\\"0\\"\\n  allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\"\\n  allowFullScreen\\n></iframe>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThe final stage was all about polish, which we picked up at the beginning of this year. By leaving a bit of space between the main implementation, or phase two, and the polish phase, phase three, it was much easier to properly scrutinize our past solutions. We forget a lot of the low level reasoning for changes, and it is easier to step back and reconsider parts of the system. For example, we found that our initial design of the `createServiceFactory` function was unnecessarily complex, and could be made much simpler for most usages. In addition to reviewing all the APIs, we also wrote more documentation to help users, ensured that the local development and testing experience was solid, and double checked that there was a smooth migration path from the old system.\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\nNow that you\u2019ve learned about the journey of designing the new system, let\u2019s review the new architecture. This blog includes a brief introduction to the architecture of the new system. If you want to dive deeper, check out our [architecture documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/architecture/).\\n\\nThe backend system has five major building blocks:\\n\\n- Backend instances act as dependency injection containers and are the unit of deployment in which you install plugins and modules that you want to use.\\n- Plugins implement the actual features and main business logic, for example the service catalog.\\n- Services provide shared utilities for plugins to use, for example logging, database access, and serving HTTP. Services are provided by the backend and can be customized in each backend instance.\\n- Extension Points serve as an optional API surface for plugins to provide deeper customization, such as installing custom processors in the catalog. It is up to each plugin to define their own extension points.\\n- Modules extend individual plugins with additional features by interacting with the extension points that the plugins expose. A module might for example implement a single entity provider for the catalog.\\n\\n![backend system architecture](assets/2023-02-15/backend-system-architecture.png)\\n\\n## Benefits of the New System\\n\\nThis new system reduced the size of a typical backend installation from hundreds of lines of code to just about two dozen, more than an order of magnitude. This reduction comes from shifting complexity away from the backend installation and into the plugins, services, and the backend system itself. Not only does this make a typical backend setup much easier to maintain, but it also makes it much easier to build plugins and modules, and leaves fewer patterns to be unnecessarily invented.\\n\\nAs part of this shift, we\u2019ve moved many concepts from being coding patterns to being features built into the framework. This will allow us to further evolve the backend system in much more interesting ways, and still bring along the entire Backstage plugin ecosystem. It also helps align Backstage plugins around a couple of extensibility patterns, rather than each plugin having their own bespoke patterns for how extensions are installed.\\n\\n## Alpha, what does it mean?\\n\\nWith the release of the backend system into alpha, we are confident enough in the design of the system that we encourage plugin owners to add support for the new system in their plugins. This means following the [plugin migration guide](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/building-plugins-and-modules/migrating) and exporting a plugin instance. Do not remove support for the old system yet \u2013 keep your existing `createRouter` export intact.\\n\\nWhile we encourage migration of plugins, we do not yet recommend migrating your backend installations to the new system. We want to create space to gather and address feedback from the plugin migration experience, and to make changes if necessary.\\n\\nIf you are worried about the upcoming backend migration, you can [take a peek](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/building-backends/migrating#migrating-the-index-file) at our `legacyPlugin` helper. It allows you to forklift over all existing plugin setups to the new backend system, and then migrate plugins one by one.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nDuring the next release we will keep working on migrating the core plugins, as well as addressing any feedback that we receive. We don\u2019t want to rush a stable release though, and won\u2019t encourage broad adoption until we\u2019re confident that we won\u2019t have to follow it up with immediate breaking changes. Yet, we are excited about where we are today, and are looking forward to the future stable release!\\n\\nUseful Links:\\n\\n- [Architecture Docs](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/architecture/)\\n- [Building Plugins](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/building-plugins-and-modules/)\\n- [Core Services](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/core-services/)\\n- [#backend-system](https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/1034089724664610938) channel in Discord"},{"id":"/2023/02/06/whats-ahead-in-2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/02/06/whats-ahead-in-2023","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-06-whats-ahead-in-2023.mdx","title":"What\u2019s Ahead in 2023?","description":"Fewer \u201Cvibes\u201D and more climbs (up the contribution ladder)","date":"2023-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":4.33,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Lee Mills","url":"https://github.com/leemills83","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"What\u2019s Ahead in 2023?","author":"Lee Mills","authorURL":"https://github.com/leemills83"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Backstage Backend System Alpha","permalink":"/blog/2023/02/15/backend-system-alpha"},"nextItem":{"title":"Scaling Backstage Ingestion with Incremental Entity Providers","permalink":"/blog/2023/01/31/incremental-entity-provider"}},"content":"![Fewer \u201Cvibes\u201D and more climbs (up the contribution ladder)](assets/2023-02-06/whats-ahead.png)\\n\\nOkay, everyone. Time to move on from all the 2022 reflections, Top 10 lists, and Wrapped(s), and turn our gaze in the other direction \u2014 towards 2023. As the Backstage team moves into the new year, we find ourselves asking those perennial questions: How can we continue to grow and enhance the Backstage community? How can we improve the experience for those adopting Backstage? How can we give the best support to Backstage contributors?\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nWell, we don\u2019t have all the answers, but we do have some. So we wanted to share more on three ongoing initiatives aimed at moving the needle forward for these three distinct, yet interrelated, questions.\\n\\n- Grow your influence by climbing the contribution ladder\\n- Come join our SIGs (and push for new ones)\\n- Work with us to drive a better experience for Backstage adopters\\n\\n# Climb the contribution ladder\\n\\nTruth be told, we\u2019ve been wanting to grow the maintainer team for some time, and have had multiple requests from contributors and contributing organizations wanting to become maintainers. But, so far, we just haven\u2019t managed to get anything off the ground. What we see is that becoming a maintainer is too hard and the current ownership model doesn\u2019t work. In short, we need to update Backstage governance.\\n\\nTo address this, we are proposing (RFC links below) the following three initiatives:\\n\\n- Introduce more steps in between first-time contributor and maintainer in the form of a contributor ladder (loosely based on the [CNCF Project Template](https://github.com/cncf/project-template/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER.md)). The ladder might look as follows: Contributor, Org Member, Reviewer, Maintainer, Project Maintainer.\\n- Change the ownership model, for example, divide the project up into several project areas, each covering particular parts of the project.\\n- Introduce a new process for large contributions in the form of Backstage Enhancement Proposals (BEPs).\\n\\nRead more and join the already rich discussion in [RFC: Updated Backstage Governance](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/15317) and [RFC: Backstage Enhancement Proposals](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/15318). The RFC will be open until 13/02/2023.\\n\\n# Come join our SIGs (and push for new ones)\\n\\nAs many of you know, SIG stands for Special Interest Group. The purpose of a SIG is to bring together maintainers and interested contributors within a certain specialist area to discuss, debate, spread knowledge, brainstorm - and drive the overall project forward. They\u2019re also a lot of fun!\\n\\nWe currently have two SIGs up and running:\\n\\n- [Catalog](https://github.com/backstage/community/tree/main/sigs/sig-catalog?utm_campaign=Newsletters%20Sent&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=241130993&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9fx-nTmQga2j12NqzZaL-lYPq-xQjDoXcWKe_JUoa2RGlK65R9j0CIygfYILr0tGEQSvRVN9xzhiJ6LmVxBthKnStfSA&utm_content=241130993&utm_source=hs_email) started up last June and covers all aspects of the systems and components related to the Software Catalog. The group runs every second Tuesday between 16:00 and 17:00 CET. Just show up or hop into [#catalog](https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/923144214580191282) (Discord), if you want to talk to us first.

In the first two meetups, we discussed adoption challenges based on user persona, collecting data about those challenges, and bootstrapping the Catalog to improve metadata quality for adopters. This one runs every second Thursday between 16:00 and 17:00 CET. Again just show up or, if you want to talk to us first, you can do so in [#adoption](https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/1045031039061479536) (Discord).

Backstage inspects and transforms an organization\'s disparate software services and parts into a centralized data store. This blog post introduces the concept of incremental entity providers, which allow Backstage to scale ingestion to even larger datasets.\\n\\n![catalog pipeline](assets/2023-01-31/catalog-pipeline.png)\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nA common use case is for an organization to want to surface ownership and metadata about repositories. Backstage provides a mechanism for discovering and transforming repository information into a standard data structure and persisting it into the Backstage [Catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/). This process is known as ingestion, where all data is transformed into a standard Backstage data structure known as an entity. Entities in the Catalog\u2019s data store are accessible to the Backstage App via the REST API.\\n\\nData is transformed into entities via what is known as the ingestion and processing loop, which can be thought of as an [extract, transform and load (ETL) pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load), where raw data such as GitHub repositories are loaded from GitHub, transformed into entities and outputted to the Catalog.\\n\\n## Entity Providers\\n\\nBackstage offers what are known as [entity providers](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/life-of-an-entity) as a means for ingesting the raw data into the pipeline and transforming them into Backstage entities. For example, Backstage comes with a [GitHub Entity Provider](https://backstage.io/api/stable/modules/_backstage_plugin-catalog-backend-module-github.html) that finds all catalog-info.yaml files in GitHub repositories. The processing loop transforms them into Backstage entities and subsequently persists them to the software catalog.\\n\\nEntity providers are a relatively new abstraction and the recommended way to ingest data into the catalog. The Backstage catalog engine starts each registered entity provider, which connects to its data source (e.g., the GitHub Entity Provider connects to GitHub). The entity provider will query the external data source and convert the data into the entity format. Finally, the entity provider issues what is known as a mutation to the catalog engine. A mutation is a signal from the entity provider to the catalog engine that entities are available to be processed and stored.\\n\\nA mutation can be either a full mutation or a delta mutation. A full mutation replaces all entities previously ingested by the entity provider with a new set of entities. The entity provider will remove all entities not found in the latest ingestion. A full mutation can be used to ingest relatively small datasets (less than 10,000 entities); however, ingesting more during a full ingestion may cause out-of-memory errors and delay the processing of entities from other entity providers. A delta mutation can surgically add and remove entities from the catalog. A delta mutation is useful when the data source provides events-based APIs like webhooks, which allows the Backstage catalog engine to ingest a small number of entities as they get added, updated and/or deleted.\\n\\n## Incremental entity providers\\n\\nA large organization typically deals with massive datasets. Until recently, ingesting large datasets with entity providers has been problematic because performing a full ingestion resulted in out-of-memory errors, and many data sources don\u2019t provide webhooks or other events-based APIs. At the same time, the datasets were too large to efficiently manage through targeted delta mutations.\\n\\nThis is a problem that [DevEx team at HP](http://hp.com) faced when building their software catalog with Backstage. [Damon Kaswell](https://github.com/dekoding), Senior Application Developer on the DevEx team at HP, shared their experience at [BackstageCon 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qHyZntKXRU&list=PLj6h78yzYM2OKySsTuiip3BqmdYZQRnSf&index=13), detailing the problem and the solution that [Frontside](https://frontside.com/) created in collaboration with developers on HP\u2019s DevEx team.\\n\\n![Damon Kaswell](assets/2023-01-31/damon.jpg)\\n\\nThe solution HP and [Frontside](https://frontside.com/) arrived at was to implement an incremental entity provider. An incremental entity provider effectively performs a full mutation using a series of delta mutations combined with a mark and sweep mechanism. It paginates through the dataset, tracking entities retrieved from each page and the cursor of the next page, pausing ingestion every few seconds to give the processing loop time to process existing entities. Once it reaches the end of the dataset, it determines which entities were not ingested during this ingestion cycle and emits a delta mutation to delete unmarked entities.\\n\\nSimply by adding a few new tables to the database schema, the incremental ingestion entity provider converts any existing entity provider into an incremental entity provider. These tables allow the incremental entity provider to be long-lived and keep track of its current location in the dataset by persisting a cursor that it uses to page through any large dataset. The larger the dataset, the more pages of data or bursts of work the incremental entity provider will ingest\u2014but there will be no out-of-memory errors, effectively removing scalability problems.\\n\\nThe results speak for themselves. Migrating from regular entity providers to incremental entity providers reduced ingestion time by 92% \u2013 from over 4 and a half hours to just 20 minutes. Incremental entity providers eliminated the ingestion maintenance burden from being a constant problem to a non-issue. Writing reliable integration with external services can now be done in days instead of weeks.\\n\\n## Go forth and ingest!\\n\\nBackstage provides a robust framework for ingesting data from external sources, but HP needed to scale it beyond its design. The Backstage framework allowed [Frontside](https://frontside.com/) and HP\u2019s developers to extend it with a plugin to support HP\u2019s scaling requirements.\\n\\nWe\'re delighted to share that as of [this PR](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/14356), the incremental ingestion backend is available for anyone to use with Backstage. The solution was released open source as [@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-incremental-ingestion](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/catalog-backend-module-incremental-ingestion#backstageplugin-catalog-backend-module-incremental-ingestion) and contains a package for creating incremental entity providers. The plugin\'s [repository README](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/catalog-backend-module-incremental-ingestion) has detailed configuration and usage outlined.\\n\\nThe incremental ingestion entity provider is an excellent addition to the Backstage stack. Battle-tested on large datasets, the incremental entity provider is a significant step forward in smoothing the path to successful ingestion at scale."},{"id":"/2022/12/19/backstage-wrapped-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/12/19/backstage-wrapped-2022","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-19-backstage-wrapped-2022.mdx","title":"Backstage Wrapped 2022","description":"wrapped header image","date":"2022-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":5.8,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Corti & Suzanne Daniels","url":"https://github.com/fcorti","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Backstage Wrapped 2022","author":"Francesco Corti & Suzanne Daniels","authorURL":"https://github.com/fcorti"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Scaling Backstage Ingestion with Incremental Entity Providers","permalink":"/blog/2023/01/31/incremental-entity-provider"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Linux Foundation launches its Introduction to Backstage course","permalink":"/blog/2022/11/15/linux-foundation-introduction-to-backstage-course"}},"content":"![wrapped header image](assets/2022-12-19/wrapped.png)\\n\\nIf 2021 was the year of growth for the Backstage project and community, 2022 can be easily defined as the year of maturity. Both the project and the community continued to grow at an incredible pace and the platform is now more stable, more secure, and more powerful than ever.\\n\\nOur community is full of people from across the globe who bring incredible engagement and positive vibes to the project. And we finally got to experience this for the first time in real life during [BackstageCon](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2OKySsTuiip3BqmdYZQRnSf), the very first in-person conference fully dedicated to Backstage, where hundreds of enthusiasts, the maintainers, adopters, and partners joined the event confirming the great momentum and the traction in the market.\\n\\nBut before anticipating too much, let\u2019s share some stats of this amazing 2022.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## We grew \u2026 a lot!\\n\\nLast year we celebrated 75 [public adopters](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md) and today we have over 600 adopters, confirming the interest around Backstage across all the industries, sectors, and dimensions. Companies like [Toyota North America](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/toyota-ecs-case-study/), Deutsche Bank, Mercedes-Benz, Procter & Gamble, Siemens, LinkedIn, and many more joined the community this year and are actively contributing in growing the product and its maturity.\\n\\n![Accelerated growth of Public Backstage Adopters, from January 2021\u2013December 2022.](assets/2022-12-19/public-backstage-adopters-2022.png)\\n\\nNot only are our adopters growing at an exponential rate, but so too are our contributors. Our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673) is a perfect example of the worlds of our adopters and contributors melding. On average, at any given hour of the day or night, there are more than 500 people online available to talk and provide support on any Backstage topic. Discord discussions run a full gamut of topics \u2013 from technical support questions to best practices for onboarding engineers to Backstage \u2013 basically, anything and everything an adopter may be interested to know and learn. At the very beginning of 2022, we \u201Conly\u201D had 4k Discord members. Today, we have a growing membership of 8.2k.\\n\\nIsn\u2019t it what we can call a great and vibrant community of enthusiasts?\\n\\nThe growth of the ecosystem is not limited to the adopters and contributors. The ecosystem also includes big tech companies interested in growing Backstage by including it as part of their offering and integrations. Our [collaboration with VMWare](https://youtube.com/watch?v=GAzKCQO8Vt0&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE) is a great example of this, and [RedHat](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/10/24/red-hat-joins-backstageio-community) joined the party this year \u2013 promising even faster growth in contributions and integrations for the Backstage project.\\n\\nBefore we go any further, let\u2019s take a quick look at some more numbers, mainly coming from the [Official Github repository](https://github.com/backstage/backstage). This year\u2026\\n\\n- Our contributors grew from a group of 500 to 900+\\n- Contributions to the project increased from 9k to 15k+\\n- The number of forks shot up from 2k to 3k+\\n- Backstage stars increased from 14k to almost 20k\\n- And lastly, we welcomed over 550 adopters into our community.\\n\\nAll of these people driving the enormous growth and maturity of the project are represented in the chart below, which shows cumulative activities per month for Backstage:\\n\\n![Main Github metrics for Backstage.io.](assets/2022-12-19/github-metrics-for-backstage-io.png)\\n\\nWow\u2026 that\u2019s a lot of activity. We\u2019ve generated this animation showing all of your contributions to the Backstage repository in 2022, look at this project grow:\\n\\n<iframe\\n  width=\\"780\\"\\n  height=\\"440\\"\\n  src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GoWBvHpH5Cg\\"\\n  frameBorder=\\"0\\"\\n  allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\"\\n  allowFullScreen\\n></iframe>\\n\\n## But wait\u2026 there\u2019s more\\n\\nThe growth of the community is so exciting to see. And with all this community growth, comes growth and maturity of the product, making Backstage better able to support adopters in their developer experience challenges. The Backstage open source project has almost [100 plugins](https://backstage.io/plugins), each one amending Backstage with a tool or service to improve not only adopters\u2019 Backstage apps, but their unique developer experiences. And almost every week we learn of a new one being contributed, which is amazing.\\n\\nThe Backstage platform itself is leaving 2022 more mature than ever, thanks to milestones such as these:\\n\\n- [Backstage is now beyond version 1](https://backstage.io/blog/2022/03/17/backstage-1.0).\\n- [Backstage had its first Security Audit ever and now can rely on a Threat Model](https://backstage.io/blog/2022/08/23/backstage-security-audit).\\n- [Backstage Learn helps adopters get started more easily](https://backstage.spotify.com/learn/).\\n- [Backstage reached incubating status as part of the CNCF ecosystem](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/15/backstage-project-joins-the-cncf-incubator/).\\n\\nAnd like every mature project, now Backstage has also a mascot: Bowie the Beaver!\\n\\n![Bowie the Beaver.](assets/2022-12-19/bowie-the-beaver.png)\\n\\nAdditionally, we launched a new [Special Interest Groups (SIGs)](https://github.com/backstage/community/tree/main/sigs) initiative this year, following the lead of Kubernetes. We believe Backstage SIGs will better coordinate contributions, grow the platform cohesively with the open source community, and allow contributors to dig even deeper as a community member. At this moment in time there two SIGs in place:\\n\\n- The [Catalog SIG](https://github.com/backstage/community/blob/main/sigs/sig-catalog/README.md), covering all aspects of the systems and components related to the Software Catalog.\\n- The [Adoption SIG](https://github.com/backstage/community/blob/main/sigs/sig-adoption/README.md), covering all aspects of the adoption journey of Backstage.\\n\\nOur plan is to open more SIGs in 2023 to engage more with the community and to keep driving towards cohesive growth for the community and project.\\n\\nLast but not least, we mustn\'t overlook the first ever conference fully dedicated to Backstage: BackstageCon. What was special there? SO much. But in particular two things: seeing everyone in real life and the incredible mood and conversations between maintainers, adopters, partners and enthusiasts. It\u2019s hard to express just how positive and amazing the vibes were in a blog, but you can read our recap [here](https://backstage.io/blog/2022/10/28/backstagecon-kubecon-2022) or watch the sessions [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2OKySsTuiip3BqmdYZQRnSf). And in the meantime, here are some great numbers from the event:\\n\\n- 250 attendees or a 100% full venue and packed room.\\n- 14 sessions\\n- 17 speakers\\n\\n## Goodbye, 2022. Hello, 2023!\\n\\nAfter this incredible year, thanks to everyone in the global Backstage community who contributed to the open source project in 2022. We are already working on the goals for 2023 \u2013 and as a roadmap teaser: we are very much committed to making the journey of adoption easier, faster, more valuable, and overall better. We would not be here today without our amazing community, so thank you for everything!\\n\\nLooking forward to continuing collaborating together for an exciting 2023.\\n\\nSee you then!

In between some creative snacks (lemon blueberry popcorn, anyone?) and coffee breaks, we heard from adopters including [Telus](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/building-for-simplicity-TELUS/), [DAZN](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/adopter-spotlight/dazn/), HP, US Bank, and more on lessons learned through their adoption journeys, we talked about different ways to leverage data within Backstage, and we discussed new ways to customize Backstage for specific adopter needs.\\n\\nYou can watch all the BackstageCon sessions, talks, and keynotes [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2OKySsTuiip3BqmdYZQRnSf)!\\n\\n### Project Meeting: Building a better Backstage together\\n\\n![project meeting image](assets/2022-10-28/real_project_meeting.jpeg)\\n\\nThe following day, the Backstage maintainers hosted a lively project meeting, where we engaged with a lot of folks that had been at BackstageCon the day before. Over the course of the meeting, the Backstage community talked through recommended approaches for maintaining your Software Catalog as a source of truth, sourcing internal contributors for organization\u2019s Backstage apps, improving frontend performance in a few plugins, how Backstage maintainers work, and appreciation for the contributions from our community. You can read more detailed notes from the project meeting in the repo [here](https://github.com/backstage/community/blob/main/project-meetings/kubecon-na-2022.md).\\n\\n### KubeCon: Demos, swag, and standing-room only\\n\\nAnd last but not least: three days of [KubeCon North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/)! At KubeCon, the Backstage team met and greeted so many new faces at our kiosk in the Project Pavilion. We ran demos, answered questions, and handed out lots and lots of SWAG!\\n\\n![maintainer presentation](assets/2022-10-28/project_meeting.jpg)\\n\\nSpotify\u2019s [Francesco Corti](https://github.com/fcorti) and core maintainer [Ben Lambert](https://github.com/benjdlambert) took the stage on Wednesday to present the Backstage maintainer talk to a PACKED audience. They discussed how core features of Backstage are changing the way end-user developers interact and manage their ecosystem, and encouraged folks to create the future of developer experience with the rest of the Backstage community. If you missed it, no worries! Their talk track will be posted on the [CNCF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/cloudnativefdn).\\n\\n\u2026and that\u2019s a wrap! What an incredible week. Our growing Backstage community continues to amaze us with its dedication and enthusiasm. We can\u2019t wait to see you all again at KubeCon Europe in The Netherlands! In fact, we\u2019d love to see our adopters give Backstage talks next year (hint, hint). The KubeCon Europe [CFP is open](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/program/cfp/#overview) until Friday, November 18, 2022."},{"id":"/2022/09/08/fyi-plugin-analytics-api","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/09/08/fyi-plugin-analytics-api","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-08-fyi-plugin-analytics-api.mdx","title":"FYI \u{1F4E3} The Plugin Analytics API","description":"TL;DR If you didn\'t know, now you know: the Backstage plugin analytics API is here to help you understand how developers in your organization are using Backstage.","date":"2022-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.63,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Peterson, Spotify","url":"https://github.com/iamEAP","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3496491?v=4","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"FYI \u{1F4E3} The Plugin Analytics API","author":"Eric Peterson, Spotify","authorURL":"https://github.com/iamEAP","authorImageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3496491?v=4"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"ICYMI: BackstageCon & KubeCon NA 2022 Recap","permalink":"/blog/2022/10/28/backstagecon-kubecon-2022"},"nextItem":{"title":"Backstage Security Audit & Updates","permalink":"/blog/2022/08/23/backstage-security-audit"}},"content":"**TL;DR** If you didn\'t know, now you know: the Backstage plugin analytics API is here to help you understand how developers in your organization are using Backstage.\\n\\n![The Plugin Analytics API](assets/22-09-08/analytics-api-fyi.png)\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## What is the plugin analytics API?\\n\\nThe plugin analytics API is a [utility api](https://backstage.io/docs/api/utility-apis) available by default in every Backstage instance, intended to bridge the gap between the needs of Backstage integrators and plugin developers. While Backstage integrators want visibility into the plugins they\u2019ve installed, they lack the power to instrument those plugins. And although plugin developers have the power to instrument plugins, they can\u2019t do so without a single, vendor-agnostic way to track events. Enter: the plugin analytics API.\\n\\nWhile \u201Canalytics\u201D as a concept can be broad, the goal of the API is narrowly focused: empower those deploying Backstage to understand usage of their instance. The plugin analytics API isn\u2019t designed to solve for observability use-cases like tracing, logging, performance monitoring, error metrics, or alerting. Rather, the API is designed to capture and quantify real user interactions, which can form the basis for metrics like daily active users, top plugins, and more.\\n\\n## Start collecting data\\n\\nBackstage core (and a few other plugins) are already instrumented with [key events](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/analytics#key-events) that are ready for you to start collecting and analyzing.\\n\\nThe simplest way to get started is to use one of the [supported analytics tools](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/analytics#supported-analytics-tools) and install its provided API implementation like you would any other utility API. For example:\\n\\n```tsx\\n// packages/app/src/apis.ts\\nimport {\\n  analyticsApiRef,\\n  configApiRef,\\n  identityApiRef,\\n} from \'@backstage/core-plugin-api\';\\nimport { GoogleAnalytics } from \'@backstage/plugin-analytics-module-ga\';\\n\\nexport const apis: AnyApiFactory[] = [\\n  // Instantiate and register the GA Analytics API Implementation.\\n  createApiFactory({\\n    api: analyticsApiRef,\\n    deps: { configApi: configApiRef, identityApi: identityApiRef },\\n    factory: ({ configApi, identityApi }) =>\\n      GoogleAnalytics.fromConfig(configApi, {\\n        identityApi,\\n      }),\\n  }),\\n];\\n```\\n\\nIf your chosen analytics tool doesn\u2019t have an integration yet, you can write a custom integration by [following these instructions](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/analytics#writing-integrations). (And if you\u2019re integrating with a publicly available analytics service, as opposed to a custom in-house system, why not [consider contributing it back to the community](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/create-a-plugin)?)\\n\\n## Instrument plugins\\n\\nWhile some key events are already instrumented, there may be important actions in open source plugins that are un-instrumented, not to mention in your custom, InnerSource plugins. Luckily, the plugin analytics API can be leveraged by open source and InnerSource plugins all the same.\\n\\nTo capture an event, invoke the `useAnalytics()` react hook and call the function it returns when the user performs the action you wish to track (e.g. merging a pull request):\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { useAnalytics } from \'@backstage/core-plugin-api\';\\n\\nconst analytics = useAnalytics();\\nanalytics.captureEvent(\'merge\', pullRequestName);\\n```\\n\\nDon\u2019t worry about having to stuff additional levels of detail into just the event action and subject, you can provide extra dimensional data on the `attributes` property, as well as a primary metric on the `value` property, like this:\\n\\n```tsx\\nanalytics.captureEvent(\'merge\', pullRequestName, {\\n  value: pullRequestAgeInMinutes,\\n  attributes: {\\n    org: orgName,\\n    repo: repoName,\\n  },\\n});\\n```\\n\\nIn situations where your plugin is tracking multiple events and you want all of those events to share common dimensional data, you can use the `<AnalyticsContext>`. Every event captured in child components underneath this context automatically inherits the values you set:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { AnalyticsContext } from \'@backstage/core-plugin-api\';\\n\\n<AnalyticsContext attributes={{ vcsProvider: \'github\' }}>\\n  {children}\\n</AnalyticsContext\\n```\\n\\nIn fact, Backstage core uses an `<AnalyticsContext>` to automatically decorate every event with a corresponding plugin ID and an extension name in order to facilitate plugin-level analysis.\\n\\nWhile the above should be enough to get you going, don\u2019t forget to check out [the complete guide to event capture](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/analytics#capturing-events), which covers event naming considerations, testing, and more.\\n\\n## Get involved\\n\\nIf you didn\u2019t know, now you know!

Today, we\u2019re releasing a report from an independent security audit and the first version of the Backstage Threat Model.\\n\\n![Backstage Security Audit & Updates](assets/22-08-23/backstage-security-audit.png)\\n\\nAs an [Incubating project](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/15/backstage-project-joins-the-cncf-incubator/) within the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/), Backstage was fortunate enough to take advantage of a sponsored security audit. The [Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF)](https://ostif.org/) sponsored the audit as part of its ongoing efforts to secure the open source software ecosystem, and the audit itself was performed by [X41 D-Sec](https://x41-dsec.de/). Our goal with the audit was to evaluate and improve Backstage\u2019s security posture, focusing on the core Backstage framework and plugins.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Report Findings and Fixes\\n\\nThe security audit and improvements concluded earlier this month, on August 18th. The audit **findings** totalled two critical, two high, five medium, and three low severity vulnerabilities, alongside 15 side findings with no direct security impact. As of the [Backstage 1.5 release](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.5.0), eight out of the 12 main findings and many of the side findings are fully remedied. If you are a few versions behind there\u2019s no need to worry though, most fixes were included in the 1.3 release.\\n\\nOut of the four findings that have yet to be fixed, three are related to rate limiting or internal DoS concerns. With the introduction of the Backstage Threat Model (more on that below), Backstage\u2019s positioning states that this is outside the scope of the security concerns of Backstage. Rather, we trust internal users of Backstage to not intentionally sabotage the availability of the service. This is not to say that we will never aim to get these findings addressed, but we have pushed them to be potential future improvements as we focus our near-term efforts on improving the product in other ways.\\n\\nThe last outstanding finding is to build out the capabilities of our service-to-service auth system. This is an area where the audit identified a couple of missing pieces in our early version of the implementation. We have since closed the gap by introducing token expiration, and will continue to work on this as we open up for more complex and hardened deployment patterns through the [evolution of the backend system](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/11611).\\n\\nAnother important finding was the potential for confusion and user impersonation due to most authentication providers having sign-in enabled by default. This finding reinforced our decision to switch sign-in to being disabled by default for all authentication providers, which was part of the [1.1 release](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.1.0).\\n\\nPerhaps the most important outcome of this audit is that it helped us focus our efforts to keep improving the security of Backstage. It identified priority areas in both implementation and documentation for us going forward. One particular area that was pointed out in a finding is the documentation around the security model of Backstage deployment. There have been several efforts to highlight this in documentation, but it is still not clear enough. What we\u2019ve been lacking is documentation that is completely dedicated towards detailing the security concerns of Backstage. That is why in addition to publishing the security audit report, we are also introducing the [Backstage Threat Model](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model).\\n\\n## Introducing the Backstage Threat Model\\n\\nThe existing Backstage documentation has many security concerns interwoven within its text, but to find them all, you need to spend a lot of time reading. We previously lacked a one-stop-shop for readers that are interested in the security model and concerns of Backstage. So, we are happy to introduce the [Backstage Threat Model](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model), which closes this gap. The Threat Model outlines key security considerations for operators, developers, and security researchers. It is a living document that will evolve and expand alongside the Backstage project.\\n\\nThe threat model document covers the trust model and roles involved in a typical Backstage setup, the responsibilities that fall on integrators of Backstage, and common configuration concerns across all Backstage projects. Beyond these three topics, it also dives deeper into a number of core features. The `auth`, `catalog`, `scaffolder`, and `techdocs` plugins are all covered separately with their individual security concerns.\\n\\nWe\u2019d like to point out a few key parts in case you are in a rush. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the integrator\'s responsibility to protect the Backstage installation from unauthorized access. If you ingest organizational data into the catalog and use that to sign in users, you\u2019ll also want to check out the first halves of the authentication and catalog sections.\\n\\n## Links and References\\n\\n- [Full Audit Report](assets/22-08-23/X41-Backstage-Audit-2022.pdf)\\n- [Backstage Security Policy](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/SECURITY.md)\\n\\nOn behalf of the Backstage maintainers and community: thanks to the CNCF, OSTIF, and X41 D-Sec for the opportunity to improve the project."},{"id":"/2022/07/19/releasing-backstage-search-1.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/07/19/releasing-backstage-search-1.0","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-19-releasing-backstage-search-1.0.mdx","title":"Releasing Backstage Search 1.0","description":"TL;DR If you\u2019ve been waiting for Backstage Search to come out of beta, we\u2019re excited to announce that Backstage Search 1.0 is here!","date":"2022-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.86,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Emma Indal, Spotify","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-indal","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Releasing Backstage Search 1.0","author":"Emma Indal, Spotify","authorURL":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-indal"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Backstage Security Audit & Updates","permalink":"/blog/2022/08/23/backstage-security-audit"},"nextItem":{"title":"Introducing the TechDocs Addon Framework","permalink":"/blog/2022/05/13/techdocs-addon-framework"}},"content":"**TL;DR** If you\u2019ve been waiting for Backstage Search to come out of beta, we\u2019re excited to announce that [Backstage Search 1.0](https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/#backstage-search-10) is here!\\n\\nWe first released the Backstage Search Platform over a year ago. Backstage Search Platform is a search experience built for you, by you.\\n\\n![Releasing Backstage Search 1.0](assets/22-07-19/releasing-backstage-search-v1.png)\\n\\nBackstage Search Platform makes it possible for you to search across your entire software ecosystem. With a Search platform that is customizable and extendable, you can identify your needs within your organization and set up search to solve these problems. Whether it is to search through the Software Catalog or technical documentation generated by the TechDocs plugin.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## So what is Backstage Search 1.0?\\n\\nSince the first release of the Backstage Search Platform, we have seen a fantastic community grow around the search plugins. To mention just a few of these contributions:\\n\\n- More search engine modules: [Elasticsearch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-elasticsearch) originally [contributed](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/6569) by Roadie and [Postgres](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-pg) originally [contributed](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/6682) by SDA SE\\n- More components: Quick search modal, originally [contributed](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/7316) by Expedia Group\\n- More plugin integrations: TechDocs also [contributed](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/6375) by Roadie and [Software Catalog](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/4515)\\n\\nThese are just a few contributions of the countless enhancements and improvements made by contributors across the globe. With a well adopted and tested search platform we feel confident to release Backstage Search as 1.0.\\n\\nPackages included in Backstage Search 1.0 release are:\\n\\n**Core search packages**\\n\\n- [@backstage/plugin-search](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search)\\n- [@backstage/plugin-search-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-react)\\n- [@backstage/plugin-search-common](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-common)\\n- [@backstage/plugin-search-backend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend)\\n- [@backstage/plugin-search-backend-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-node)\\n\\n**Modules**\\n\\n- [@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-elasticsearch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-elasticsearch)\\n\\nNo additional features are released as part of the major release as the maintainers of the search packages focused on the following for this release:\\n\\n- Bug fixes and clean up of deprecations.\\n- Improved error handling for missing indices.\\n- Separation of AWS Elastic and Open Elastic support.\\n- Refactor the packages by moving reusable components from `@backstage/plugin-search` to `@backstage/plugin-search-react`.\\n- Improved documentation including tutorials for how to [Integrate Search into a plugin](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/integrating-search-into-plugins).\\n\\nYou might have noticed that the [@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-pg) package is not part of 1.0. That\u2019s because that package is a community supported module, and therefore we have not included it as part of 1.0. If you are interested in pushing the Postgres engine to 1.0, feel free to reach out to us in the [#search](https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/770283289327566848) channel on Discord.\\n\\n## Elasticsearch as the recommended engine for production usage\\n\\nWhen the Backstage Search Platform was first released, it came with an in-memory search engine as default - Lunr. While this is a good engine to use on a smaller scale and for local development (to avoid having to set up a search engine instance separately), it also has its limitations such as:\\n\\n- Lunr does not scale well. Horizontally scaled deployments of Backstage and/or Backstage Search backend using Lunr result in either duplicated indexing processes and indices or inconsistent index state across nodes.\\n- Lunr\u2019s filter functionality is limited, especially for [logical AND/OR operators](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js/issues/353).\\n- Lunr has a smaller community than Elasticsearch, which could mean that adopters relying on it will have less by way of resources for iterating on and improving search.\\n\\nTherefore, we recommend using Elasticsearch for production usage. Moving forward, the search maintainers will prioritize the Elasticsearch engine while we\u2019ll rely on the community to maintain the Postgres engine.\\n\\n## How to contribute\\n\\nIf you want to contribute and to further improve search, you can check out the [open issues labeled with search](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+search+label%3Asearch+is%3Aopen) or reach out to us at the [#search](https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/770283289327566848) Discord channel.\\n\\n## How to get started\\n\\nIf you haven\u2019t adopted the Backstage Search Platform yet and feel like now is a good time.

It\'s a solid foundation! But TechDocs doesn\'t solve higher order documentation needs on its own such as: How do you create and reinforce a culture of documentation? How do you build trust in the quality of technical documentation?\\n\\nTo address this need, we\u2019re proud to introduce the [TechDocs Addon Framework](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/9636) \u2014 a way for us all to contribute and share additional features, TechDocs Addons, on top of the base docs-like-code experience. Using TechDocs Addons, you can customize the TechDocs experience to address some of these higher order needs.\\n\\n# Open source Addons from Spotify\\n\\nWe plan to open source many of the TechDocs Addons that we use at Spotify. The first Addon we open sourced is ReportIssue, which you can start using today. ReportIssue enables you to highlight text on a page and quickly raise a templated issue for that text, in your version control system (currently supports GitHub and GitLab). The following images depict this Addon in practice.\\n\\n![techdocs-addon1](assets/22-05-13/techdocs-addon1.png)\\n\\n![techdocs-addon2](assets/22-05-13/techdocs-addon2.png)\\n\\nOther Addons coming soon include a Stack Overflow card to surface relevant questions and answers and an Issue Counter.\\n\\n![techdocs-addon3](assets/22-05-13/techdocs-addon3.png)\\n\\nWe encourage you to use Addons that we open source and contribute Addons of your own as you solve technical documentation problems arising in your company. We can\u2019t wait to see what you come up with!\\n\\nHere are some resources to help you get started with new TechDocs Addons:\\n\\n- [Installing and using Addons](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/addons#installing-and-using-addons): add an existing TechDocs Addon to your Backstage App\\n- [Creating an Addon](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/addons#creating-an-addon): contribute a new Addon for others to use\\n- [TechDocs Addon page](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/addons): read everything you need to know about TechDocs Addons\\n\\n# Next steps\\n\\nAt present, the TechDocs Addon Framework is focused on frontend experiences only. We know what\u2019s available now is a solid foundation, but based on our experience developing and maintaining Addons over several years, we know there\u2019s more to be done.\\n\\nOne such pattern is the occasional need for Addons to retrieve or compute data that is not easily accessible.

Now hundreds of adopters are using Backstage as the single pane of glass for their core development, managing millions of components and technical documentation, and helping hundreds of thousands of developers be more productive and happy.\\n\\nThis milestone demonstrates Backstage\u2019s maturity and the incredible effort from the core maintainers, contributors, and adopters. In a short time, we\u2019ve seen a global community grow rapidly with people bringing their passion to this project and our goal of empowering developers. Because, yes, this is also your goal and your time to celebrate.\\n\\n# So what is Backstage 1.0?\\n\\nIf you\u2019re thinking \u201Cwhat is Backstage 1.0, and what does it include?\u201D You\u2019re not alone, so let\u2019s get into it.\\n\\nTo start, let\u2019s define Backstage: it\u2019s an open platform for building developer portals, mainly defined by a set of libraries together with plugins that can be added, removed, or customized so that the final behavior of the developer portal product is what an adopter wants. For the past two years, the open source platform has been in beta. With Backstage 1.0, we\'re coming out of beta and into production with regular versioning and release cycle commitments. So, if your company requires production-ready software, you can now use Backstage and join [over 100 other public adopters](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md)!\\n\\nOur definition of Backstage 1.0 includes:\\n\\n- Backstage Core 1.0 libraries as the set of libraries to make the platform work\\n- [Backstage Software Catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/) 1.0\\n- [Backstage Software Templates](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/) 1.0\\n- [Backstage TechDocs](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/) 1.0\\n\\nComing soon: [Backstage Search](https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/) 1.0 will be included in the near future as part of the regular releases to the Backstage platform.\\n\\nIn terms of features, the maintainers will not be shipping new stuff as part of the major release but instead:\\n\\n- Refactoring the code packaging to better reflect the release numbering\\n- Removal of deprecated services to reduce the risk of introducing breaking changes\\n- Establishing clarity on the release lifecycle, numbering, and cadence as well as the support model\\n- Improvements to Backstage.io documentation\\n\\n# The road ahead\\n\\nIn terms of maturity and stability, the road ahead for Backstage is bright and busy. The goal is to bring Backstage to the next level of maturity and continue improving it, according to adopter growth, feature set, and identified use cases.\\n\\nYou can read more about Backstage\u2019s roadmap [here](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/roadmap), but in terms of maturity and stability we would like to highlight the following:\\n\\n- CNCF incubation: The Backstage project [recently moved from Sandbox to Incubation](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/15/backstage-project-joins-the-cncf-incubator/) phase within the [CNCF maturity levels](https://www.cncf.io/projects/#:~:text=Maturity%20levels,should%20be%20adopting%20different%20projects.).\\n- Security auditing and strategy: With the CNCF\u2019s support, the project maintainers are working on a security audit initiative to make the platform more secure and will share more details soon. The audit is part of an overall security strategy being developed this quarter.\\n- Paid plugins for advanced and enterprise use cases: Last year, [Spotify announced its work on paid plugins](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/paid-plugins-announcement/) built on top of the Backstage open source platform. This is another example of the platform\u2019s maturity and Spotify\u2019s continued commitment to the project, with a focus on customers and use cases requiring enterprise-focused support and plugins developed and proven by Spotify.\\n\\n# Some links to peruse\\n\\nIf you want to know more about this first major release, check out the following links to learn more about this release effort and receive support.\\n\\n- [Release notes](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.0.0) and [Changelog](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/releases/tag/v1.0.0).\\n- [Backstage official documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/) and [backstage.spotify.com](https://backstage.spotify.com/).\\n- [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673).\\n- [Backstage repository on GitHub](https://github.com/backstage/backstage).\\n- [List of public adopters](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md)."},{"id":"/2022/03/16/backstage-turns-two","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/03/16/backstage-turns-two","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-16-backstage-turns-two.mdx","title":"Backstage Turns Two!","description":"A cake celebrating Backstage\u2019s second birthday","date":"2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":5.87,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Lee Mills, Spotify","url":"https://github.com/leemills83","imageURL":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1236238?s=460&v=4","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Backstage Turns Two!","author":"Lee Mills, Spotify","authorURL":"https://github.com/leemills83","authorImageURL":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1236238?s=460&v=4"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"New release: Backstage 1.0","permalink":"/blog/2022/03/17/backstage-1.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"Avoid upgrade surprises with Backstage Upgrade Helper","permalink":"/blog/2022/03/04/backstage-upgrade-helper"}},"content":"![A cake celebrating Backstage\u2019s second birthday](assets/22-03-16/backstage-2nd-birthday.gif)\\n\\n**TLDR:** Backstage has turned two. Of course, this is software, so we expect things to move fast. But when you have a passionate, worldwide community building together, we\u2019ve now seen firsthand just how fast that can be. We\u2019re marking our second year as a community by becoming a CNCF incubating project, reaching 100 public adopters, releasing version 1.0 of the core app, and other very nice birthday gifts. Rather than a toddler finding their feet, Backstage today is beginning to look awfully grown-up for a two-year-old.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Out of the Sandbox and into Incubation\\n\\nTwo years ago, a small team at Spotify launched Backstage into open source during our internal Hack Week. We knew we had something special on our hands and that Backstage could potentially be the most ambitious open source project in Spotify\u2019s history (you can listen to me wax philosophical on this topic more in [Episode 2 of the new NerdOut@Spotify podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/332yTwGiILGKTS7dsHCj2P?si=pX9xTzB2SgmsROdlLLr24A).)\\n\\nWhen Spotify donated the project to the CNCF, we saw it as the first promising step toward making Backstage an industry standard. As the home to Kubernetes, Envoy, and so many other game-changing open technologies, the CNCF and its community has had a wide-ranging impact on the daily lives of developers everywhere. And that\u2019s what we hoped for Backstage, even back then.\\n\\nBut we couldn\'t have envisioned where we\u2019d be two years later \u2014 part of an ever-growing community of people that feel as passionate as we do about unlocking better developer experience for every engineering organization.\\n\\nYesterday, the CNCF announced that its [Technical Oversight Committee](https://github.com/cncf/toc) (TOC) voted to accept Backstage as a [CNCF incubating project](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/15/backstage-project-joins-the-cncf-incubator/). The move from the CNCF Sandbox to Incubation is an important step forward for the project\u2019s technical governance.\\n\\nIt\u2019s also recognition for all the work the Backstage open source community has done to advance and grow this project since we launched the repo on GitHub just a few weeks after that Hack Week. We still have a long way to go to becoming the standard, but moving out of the CNCF Sandbox and beginning the Incubation phase is further validation of those aspirations.\\n\\n## What do retailers, gaming studios, banks, airlines, streamers, startups, and enterprise software makers all have in common?\\n\\nDevelopers, developers, developers \u2014 that\u2019s what all companies have in common. Developers dealing with [more complexity](https://youtu.be/85TQEpNCaU0) than they\u2019ve ever had to deal with before. Developers who want to be able to go from idea to bug fix or feature faster.\\n\\nTwo years in, the Backstage ecosystem has grown by leaps and bounds. More than 5,000 contributors have joined the project and are submitting bugs, adding new features, and building valuable plugins that benefit the greater community. From [Expedia Group](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/measuring-backstage-proof-of-value-at-expedia/) (adopter No.18) to Unity (adopter No.67), Backstage now has [100 publicly listed adopters](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md) across a variety of industries, including retail, gaming, financial services, manufacturing, and government.\\n\\nWe have companies like [Roadie](http://roadie.io) providing hosting solutions and ThoughtWorks [providing technology and consulting services](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/about-us/news/2021/thoughtworks-is-collaborating-with-spotify-to-deliver-better-dev) to teams looking to stand up Backstage in their own orgs. We\u2019re starting to see more and more job listings for Backstage developers which tells us that companies of all shapes and sizes are going all-in on Backstage and developer effectiveness.\\n\\nAlso, I\u2019ll pause now to give a special shoutout to our early adopters. They stuck with us through all the bumps and breaking changes. But because of their early commitment, we now see instances of Backstage up and running in so many different kinds of engineering organizations. From [Zalando](https://youtu.be/6sg5uMCLxTA) to [American Airlines](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/adopter-spotlight/american-airlines-runway/) and [Brex](https://backstage.spotify.com/blog/community-session/11-brex-backstage-upgrade-helper/), the growing pains of our earliest adopters helped pave the way for smoother adoptions for all who follow them.\\n\\nA few more numbers that make us proud:\\n\\n- 2,000+ project forks\\n- 20,000+ commits\\n- 10,000+ PRs & issues\\n- 15,000+ stars on GitHub\\n- 60+ open source plugins in the [Backstage Plugin Marketplace](https://backstage.io/plugins)\\n\\n## A global community of friendly, helpful contributors\\n\\nWe open sourced Backstage in March 2020 and then almost immediately went into lockdown. When you think about this project in the context of the pandemic, it\'s really remarkable how much this community has been able to achieve.\\n\\nThe Backstage community is truly global with adopters and contributors from almost every continent (sorry, Antarctica!) coming together to share what they\u2019ve worked on and demo cool stuff in our monthly Community Sessions. The repo and the Discord server truly never sleep as a growing group of dedicated Backstage experts outside Spotify support one another and offer help 24/7.\\n\\nWe asked a few contributors and maintainers to share their thoughts around this two-year milestone.\\n\\n<iframe\\n  width=\\"780\\"\\n  height=\\"440\\"\\n  src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-j-waaybcH0\\"\\n  frameBorder=\\"0\\"\\n  allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\"\\n  allowFullScreen\\n></iframe>\\n\\nWarms the heart, doesn\u2019t it? Thanks again to all our contributors for making this possible. Seriously. We\u2019re proud of what the community has accomplished and how we\u2019ve accomplished it. All along, it\u2019s your enthusiasm and warm/collaborative/positive vibes that have carried us and this project through.\\n\\n##\xa0Version 1.0 and beyond\\n\\nTomorrow, we\u2019ll be releasing version 1.0 of the Backstage core framework, including Software Catalog, Software Templates, TechDocs, and API Reference. With Backstage 1.0, the project\u2019s core components are coming out of beta and into production with regular versioning and release cycle commitments (check back on this blog for more details!).\\n\\nv1.0 paves the way for more adoption, a bigger community, more contributions \u2014 and with this continued growth in the ecosystem, we expect even greater innovation on the platform just on the horizon with exchange of features and plugins.\\n\\nWhat comes next for Backstage is \u2014 in many ways \u2014 entirely up to you. We are looking to this community to [help us shape the next year](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/roadmap).\\n\\nIf you\u2019re already a part of this community, thank you for your hard work and dedication. Backstage wouldn\u2019t be where it is today without you. We\u2019ve come a long way together, but there\u2019s still so much to do.\\n\\nAnd if you haven\u2019t signed up yet, there\u2019s plenty of room on this party boat! And there\u2019s never been a better time to hop on board. As Irma ([@Irma12](https://github.com/Irma12)) said so beautifully: where else is there an opportunity to have so many people look at your code, hear you out, and help you out?\\n\\nTake a look at how to [start contributing](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [join the community](https://github.com/backstage/community)!"},{"id":"/2022/03/04/backstage-upgrade-helper","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/03/04/backstage-upgrade-helper","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-04-backstage-upgrade-helper.mdx","title":"Avoid upgrade surprises with Backstage Upgrade Helper","description":"backstage header","date":"2022-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":4.18,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Vincenzo Scamporlino, Spotify","url":"https://github.com/vinzscam","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8433119?v=4","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Avoid upgrade surprises with Backstage Upgrade Helper","author":"Vincenzo Scamporlino, Spotify","authorURL":"https://github.com/vinzscam","authorImageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8433119?v=4"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Backstage Turns Two!","permalink":"/blog/2022/03/16/backstage-turns-two"},"nextItem":{"title":"Say Hi to Backstage homepage templates!","permalink":"/blog/2022/01/25/backstage-homepage-templates"}},"content":"![backstage header](assets/22-03-04/backstage-upgrade-helper-post-header.png)\\n\\n_TLDR;_ The Spotify team recently announced [Backstage Upgrade Helper](https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper): a tool that helps adopters keep their Backstage application up-to-date. **Spoiler alert**: this is also a hidden and heartwarming tale about the beauty of open source innovation.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Upgrading Backstage was a common pain point\\n\\nWithout a doubt, one of the most exciting things about Backstage is our community. Step into our daily [Discord conversations](https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673) and the monthly [Community Sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMQYSTKAx0) and you\u2019ll find a ton of great ideas, problem-solving, and support for one another.\\n\\nDuring one of these discussions, we realized we all shared the same pain point \u2014 upgrading a Backstage application.\\n\\nThe Backstage open source project is in hyper-growth mode, where dozens of pull requests are merged each day. This means adopters need to go through the upgrade process more often in order to get the latest and greatest features. The Spotify team heard a lot of feedback about how painful and manual this process was \u2014 so we decided to tackle this problem during one of our internal Hack Days.\\n\\nAt Spotify, we run Hack Days every month and a lot of ideas come from those sessions (in fact, the idea to open source Backstage itself [was born on a Hack Day](https://open.spotify.com/episode/332yTwGiILGKTS7dsHCj2P)!). During a brainstorming session, we noticed that another open source community faced a similar upgrading problem years back and came up with a really good solution.\\n\\nIf you have ever worked on a React Native project, you might immediately recognize what we are referring to: The [React Native Upgrade Helper](https://github.com/react-native-community/upgrade-helper) \u2014 a web tool to support React Native developers in upgrading their apps \u2014 might have saved hours of your time. It certainly saved us hours of ours. So we looked into the project details and discovered it could fulfill our Backstage needs.\\n\\nWe started by creating a fork from React Native\u2019s open source project, applying a few changes on top of it to introduce Backstage support, and \u2014 _ecco_ \u2014 we had a new Backstage Upgrade Helper! In just a few days with pretty minimal effort, we created a product that would save a lot of time for the entire Backstage community. And we had fun at the same time (happy developers make happy code \u{1F601} ).\\n\\n## So what is Backstage Upgrade Helper?\\n\\nThe Backstage Upgrade Helper tool enables adopters to easily upgrade their Backstage app by using the power of git to create a diff between different versions.\\n\\nWhenever a new version of Backstage is released, the Helper scaffolds a new sample Backstage app using the `backstage-create-app` cli utility and checks all the generated files in a specific git branch. After the branch is generated, it gets compared with all the existing ones, which results in generating specific git patches stored in specific files. By selecting the version of the current Backstage release together with the version you want to upgrade to, the UI knows which patch file needs to be picked up.\\n\\nSo, now you can update your Backstage application in three steps rather than manually reading the changelogs of all the Backstage modules in reverse order.\\n\\n### To use the Upgrade Helper, follow these simple steps\\n\\n1. Go to the [Backstage Upgrade Helper](https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper) and enter your current release and the release you would like to upgrade to.\\n\\n2. Press **Show me how to upgrade!** After that, the feature spits out the changes between the two Backstage versions in a split-screen view for easy comparison.\\n\\n   ![Backstage Upgrade Helper in action](assets/22-03-04/backstage-upgrade-helper.gif)\\n\\n3. Apply the suggested changes to your source code to correctly upgrade your app to the selected Backstage version. This will let you directly migrate from the version you\u2019re currently using to the target version and skip all the intermediate steps you would have otherwise gone through manually reading all the changelogs.\\n\\n[Watch the Upgrade Helper demo](https://youtu.be/nYjI2j-lWEM?t=410).\\n\\n## Open source inspires\\n\\nThus far, the Backstage Upgrade Helper has gotten a lot of good feedback from the community and we\u2019re sure to see awesome contributions in the future. But all the credit behind this idea goes to the React Native community.\\n\\nWith React Native\u2019s open source contributions, we were able to quickly solve a tough problem for the entire Backstage community. Not only did React Native\u2019s project save us time creating a new product, but it has also saved our adopters time upgrading Backstage.\\n\\nThis is why we love working in open source. The hard work done for one community has the power to influence and inspire another community. We hope Backstage can do the same and pay it forward to other open source projects.\\n\\nFor more Backstage Upgrade Helper resources, check out the [UI code](https://github.com/backstage/upgrade-helper) and the [git patches](https://github.com/backstage/upgrade-helper-diff)."},{"id":"/2022/01/25/backstage-homepage-templates","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/01/25/backstage-homepage-templates","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-25-backstage-homepage-templates.mdx","title":"Say Hi to Backstage homepage templates!","description":"This blog post is co-authored by Emma Indal (@emmaindal), Spotify.","date":"2022-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.69,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kat Zhou, Spotify","url":"https://github.com/KatherineZhou","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16808998?v=4","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Say Hi to Backstage homepage templates!","author":"Kat Zhou, Spotify","authorURL":"https://github.com/KatherineZhou","authorImageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16808998?v=4"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Avoid upgrade surprises with Backstage Upgrade Helper","permalink":"/blog/2022/03/04/backstage-upgrade-helper"},"nextItem":{"title":"Backstage Wrapped 2021","permalink":"/blog/2021/12/20/backstage-wrapped-2021"}},"content":"_This blog post is co-authored by Emma Indal ([@emmaindal](https://github.com/emmaindal)), Spotify._\\n\\n![homepage template](assets/22-01-25/homepage-template-blog-post-header.png)\\n\\n_TLDR;_ We\u2019re excited to announce the arrival of homepage templates for Backstage.

This template can be found in our [Backstage Storybook](https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-templates--default-template), as well as future templates that we build.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Why homepage templates?\\n\\nAt Spotify, the Backstage homepage is one of the most commonly used pages, primarily leveraged to quickly find and easily access things. Most of our users start off their Backstage experience on the homepage to quickly pivot to their intended destination. For example, folks generally prefer having a search bar available for quickly finding what they are looking for. Backstage users at Spotify also prefer having a central toolkit for navigating to tools that exist within the organization and for accessing their favorite entities and documentation pages.\\n\\n![Backstage homepage at Spotify](assets/22-01-25/spotify-backstage-homepage.png)\\n\\nBut we also know that all organizations look different and have different needs. Backstage is designed with this in mind, and so is the homepage plugin. You can modify and customize your version of the Home plugin so it fits with your needs. Sometimes customizing and configuring your app can be overwhelming to get started, with the [homepage templates](https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-templates--default-template) and components we can provide recommendations and guidelines to make adoption of Backstage more streamlined and simplified.\\n\\n## What are homepage templates?\\n\\nA homepage template is just a template of what a homepage can look like. You can either copy it as a whole, or pick different components from it to use. The homepage templates live in our [Backstage Storybook](https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-templates--default-template) and we hope to see this collection grow with contributions from you all. If you don\u2019t want to use one of the templates, you can pick and choose from our collection of [homepage components](https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-components) that you can use right out of the box and compose your own homepage. We\u2019ve included the [SearchBar](https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-components-searchbar--custom-styles), [CompanyLogo](https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-components-companylogo--custom-logo) and [Toolkit](https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-home-components-toolkit--default) components in our Backstage Storybook as of today.

First, to the publicly listed adopters as your visible support for the project excites others to learn more about Backstage. Second, to those non-listed adopters, many of whom still engage in the community via issues, comments, or code contributions. Thank you!\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Why we care about public adopters\\n\\n![The pace of public adoption has accelerated over the last year](assets/21-09-30/public-backstage-adopters.png)\\n\\nIf you roll the clock back to early 2020 when Backstage was open sourced, we never could\u2019ve imagined surpassing this milestone. It feels particularly big given that Backstage tends to be adopted by complex organizations with hundreds (if not thousands of) developers and thousands (if not tens of thousands) of software components.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve also seen such diverse examples of Backstage in the wild. Adopters as varied as [American Airlines][am] and [Splunk][sp] have demoed their Backstage-built developer portals. We\u2019ve seen digital-first companies like [Zalando][za] and [DAZN][da] share their journey from proof-of-concept to in-production. And the developer experience team at [Expedia Group][ex] has been shared at multiple Community Sessions, detailing their adoption journey as well as contributing back with ideas for new features.\\n\\nFor the Backstage project, public adopters are important because they provide a wide variety of use cases, industries, and degrees of complexity (teams, number of services, etc.) that Backstage is able to support. In addition, a growing adopters list shows the project\u2019s maturity and helps other organizations understand the benefits and make the decision to join the project and the community.\\n\\nIn other words, the more the public adopters list grows and becomes more diverse, the more the community will grow and provide contributions that benefit all adopters.\\n\\n## Fifty is just the beginning\\n\\n![Backstage is growing: 52+ pull requests per week, excluding maintainers. Over 13,000 stars on GitHub. 518 total contributors, with about 7+ new contributors per week.](assets/21-09-30/backstage-stats.png)\\n\\nWhile we\u2019re thrilled to celebrate this milestone, the public adopters list is just one metric we monitor in the overall health of the Backstage project. It definitely doesn\u2019t tell the whole story! We\u2019re seeing continued growth within the contributor community, PRs, and GitHub overall ratings as well. As fate would have it, we also recently reached 50+ plugins in the [Backstage Plugin Marketplace][plugins]!\\n\\n## Join us!\\n\\nIf you are a Backstage enthusiast, please [join me][news] and the entire Backstage Team in celebrating this milestone.

We continue to focus on improving the stability and scalability of Backstage while enhancing its functionality. Thanks to focused efforts from the TechDocs core team and community, we\'re happy to say that TechDocs \u2014 [our docs-like-code solution](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/09/08/announcing-tech-docs) for all the software in your catalog \u2014 is now, after [Software Templates](https://backstage.io/blog/2021/07/26/software-templates-are-now-in-beta), the second core feature to graduate to beta.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nIn addition to new features and improvements, we made numerous compatibility updates ahead of this feature release. You\'ll find support for a variety of CI systems, cloud storage solutions, and source control systems \u2014 so that TechDocs works for most orgs, right out of box. But there\'s much more to explore in this beta, thanks to contributions from the community.\\n\\nWhen we set out to define what beta looked like, we combed through GitHub issues, Discord discussions, and other media to identify common pain points and challenges encountered by those around the world who consume and author TechDocs documentation in their organization\'s Backstage instance. Based on this research, we put together a user-focused milestone and got to work. For an issue-by-issue breakdown, check out the milestone [on GitHub](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/29?closed=1) \u2014 or, just read on to get the highlights.\\n\\n## Real-time builds and feedback\\n\\n![Click the refresh button to hot-reload the updated content](assets/21-09-16/refresh-button.gif)\\n\\nTechDocs can be transformational once fully up and running (update your code and your docs with the same pull request!). But for first-time users and especially those unfamiliar with the MkDocs ecosystem upon which TechDocs is built, there are often many small, obtuse hurdles that can get in the way of success. Leading up to the beta release, we worked to surface and improve relevant errors and other details during the documentation generation process. Better still, all of this detail is now provided to users _in real-time_, as docs are generated and refreshed.\\n\\n<p>\\n  \u{1F64C} Shout out to <a href=\\"https://github.com/dhenneke\\">Dominik Henneke</a> for\\n  implementing the interactive experience.\\n</p>\\n\\n## Custom homepages: Make TechDocs yours\\n\\n![TechDocs custom homepage](assets/21-09-16/techdocs-custom-homepage.png)\\n\\nWe strive to make it so that you can mold Backstage into the shape that best fits your organization. With this beta release, just as you can with the Catalog entities and [Search](https://backstage.io/blog/2021/06/24/announcing-backstage-search-platform#composable-search-page-experiences), you can now customize and compose your own TechDocs homepage. Use it to level up the front page of your Backstage documentation by highlighting golden documentation at your company, or use the new and improved (and Catalog-inspired) experience. Read more about [how to customize the TechDocs homepage](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/how-to-guides#how-to-customize-the-techdocs-home-page).\\n\\n<p>\\n  \u{1F64F} Thanks to <a href=\\"https://github.com/kuangp\\">Phil Kuang</a> for the\\n  improved default TechDocs home experience.\\n</p>\\n\\n## Simpler YAML annotations: What\'s in a ref?\\n\\n![A simpler techdocs-ref annotation value](assets/21-09-16/techdocs-ref.png)\\n\\nWe often forget that in order to enable TechDocs on a Catalog entity, documentation authors have to sprinkle a little ref annotation voodoo into their catalog-info.yaml file. The form of this magic \u2014 the `backstage.io/techdocs-ref` annotation \u2014 has evolved over TechDocs\' life. But unless you\'re a real Backstage aficionado, the specifics of what the value meant and how to construct it could be somewhat of a mystery.\\n\\nIn the beta, we\'ve simplified this annotation dramatically for documentation authors, aligning its value with TechDocs\' docs-like-code philosophy itself. In the vast majority of cases, its value will simply be `dir:.` \u2014 which means this catalog entity contains documentation and the mkdocs.yml file describing this documentation lives in the current directory. We continue to support edge cases for [other techdocs-ref annotation values](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/how-to-guides#how-to-understand-techdocs-ref-annotation-values), as well.\\n\\n<p>\\n  \u{1F44F} Another round of applause for Dominik for driving this improvement through.\\n</p>\\n\\n## Everything neat and tidy\\n\\nIf you\'ve ever twitched a little looking at the address bar as you navigated through your TechDocs, because the \\"C\\" in \\"Component\\" was capitalized, or cringed whilst perusing through your TechDocs storage bucket, only to see assets you definitely remember deleting from a documentation site cluttering up the place\u2026twitch and cringe no more!\\n\\nTechDocs base paths are now case-insensitive, stale files are automatically cleaned up by the TechDocs publishing process \u2014 and even though [I say _.yaml_ and you say _.yml_](https://open.spotify.com/track/6NDaYWg85ZnJ3Ae0WkILWh) \u2014 TechDocs will now happily accept either file extension for your MkDocs YAML file.\\n\\n## What should I do to upgrade?\\n\\nIf you\'ve been waiting for the beta to give TechDocs a shot, good news! You\'ll get all of the above, plus all of TechDocs\' existing features, right out of the box. Newly created Backstage apps come ready-to-go. You\'ll know you\'re on beta if you\'re using the following versions:\\n\\n- TechDocs Plugin version >= 0.11.0\\n- TechDocs Backend Plugin version >= 0.10.0\\n- TechDocs CLI version >= 0.7.0\\n\\nIf you\'re upgrading from a prior, alpha version of TechDocs, be aware that there are some breaking changes that you will need to account for. Most importantly:\\n\\n- Be sure your app\'s instance of TechDocs is wired up to use the composability API. [See full routing instructions here](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/create-app/CHANGELOG.md#0338).\\n- If you\'ve configured TechDocs to publish generated content to a remote storage solution provider like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage, you will need to use the TechDocs CLI to migrate the contents of your storage bucket. [See full migration instructions here](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/how-to-guides#how-to-migrate-from-techdocs-alpha-to-beta).\\n- In order to take advantage of the stale file deletion functionality, you may need to add some permissions to the account or role used by your TechDocs backend to publish contents to your storage provider. [See \\"Using Cloud Storage docs\\"](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/using-cloud-storage) for updated permissions recommendations.\\n\\nThanks again to the whole community for hitting this milestone with us!

Throughout the year, we\u2019ve been focussed on improving the stability and scalability of these areas while enhancing the feature sets based upon requests from the community. Software Templates \u2014 which enable push-button deployments with all your standards and best practices built-in \u2014 is our first feature-complete release candidate to graduate to beta. Read on to learn how this release improves template customization and flexibility, as well as performance.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nLet\u2019s rewind a little bit, around a year in fact. Backstage had been open sourced, and we released our first version of Software Templates and our Scaffolder plugin.\\n\\nIn case you missed it, [Software Templates](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/08/05/announcing-backstage-software-templates) are part of the Create feature set, where you can set up Backstage to give your engineers the ability to spin up a new microservice, website, or any other software component with your organization\u2019s best practices built-in, right from the start.\\n\\nBack when we released the first version of these templates, with the `apiVersion` `backstage.io/v1alpha1`, they were a little restrictive in what they could do. The generated repository could only have one template source and it was restricted to only being [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) templates. And it had to fit into the three stages of templating which was `Prepare`, `Template`, and `Publish`.\\n\\nWe [opened up for feedback](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/2771) from the community knowing that this wasn\u2019t going to be the final version, but something of a stepping stone to where we want to be in the future.\\n\\nAnd now we come to today\u2026\\n\\n## Anddddd\u2026 Action(s)! \u{1F3AC}\\n\\nFollowing the removal of the previously deprecated `backstage.io/v1alpha1` templates, today we\u2019re officially announcing the beta version of Software Templates, or `backstage.io/v1beta2`.\\n\\nWith it comes an entirely new architecture to the Software Templates functionality, and a load of new exciting features, which I\u2019ll dig into a little deeper.\\n\\n### Template actions\\n\\nWe\u2019ve totally opened up the ability to compose your own workflows for each Template that you have registered in Software Templates. This means no restrictions on where your template skeleton is kept, and no restrictions on what your workflow should look like.\\n\\nTemplate Actions are customizable JavaScript functions that allow you to extend the capabilities of the Software Templates by adding your own business logic or reusing some of our Built-In actions.\\n\\n![New template syntax with actions](assets/21-07-26/example-template-code.png)\\n\\n_An example of the new template syntax with steps and parameters_\\n\\nThe workflow for Software Templates are now step-based, and each Software Template can have a customizable amount of steps which will in turn call these new actions.\\n\\n![New steps being rendered in the frontend](assets/21-07-26/steps-running.gif)\\n\\n_An example of a Template with customizable steps_\\n\\nThese actions are very heavily inspired by GitHub Actions and GitHub Workflows, and we\u2019ve given back a lot of control to the template authors so they can build the boilerplate and push the code however they want.\\n\\n### Custom UI extensions\\n\\nA large part of the Software Templates feature is the form that we use to collect user input which is then passed on to these new actions. Sometimes, it makes sense that Template Authors want to provide their own React components which can be rendered in the frontend to maybe do some more complex things like calling internal APIs to provide autocomplete.\\n\\nThis is now possible with the new `ScaffolderFieldExtensions`.\\n\\n![Custom UI extensions](assets/21-07-26/custom-components.gif)\\n\\n_An example of `ScaffolderFieldExtension` is the `OwnerPicker` component which can automatically add options and suggest typeahead with data from an async API request_\\n\\nTemplate Authors can create their own components to provide data to the custom actions in any way you see fit, and even override our own built in ones too like the `RepoUrlPicker`.\\n\\n### Horizontal scalability\\n\\nThe Scaffolder Service and Software Templates are now horizontally scalable, coordinating work between your deployed backend machines. This means now that the number of instances of the `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend` plugin you have, is the same amount of jobs that you can have in parallel. This ensures that your tasks are handled quickly and reliably, while providing great feedback in the process.\\n\\n## Try out the new templates\\n\\nWe\u2019re still on the journey to making the Software Templates a great user experience for both authors and developers \u2014 but we\u2019re not done yet, so watch this space for new exciting features to come!\\n\\nIn the meantime, make sure to visit the documentation for [building templates](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/adding-templates) or creating your own [custom actions](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/writing-custom-actions)."},{"id":"/2021/06/24/announcing-backstage-search-platform","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/06/24/announcing-backstage-search-platform","source":"@site/blog/2021-06-24-announcing-backstage-search-platform.mdx","title":"Announcing the Backstage Search platform: a customizable search tool built just for you","description":"Backstage Search platform","date":"2021-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":7.16,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Emma Indal, Spotify","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-indal","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Announcing the Backstage Search platform: a customizable search tool built just for you","author":"Emma Indal, Spotify","authorURL":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-indal"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Software Templates is now in Beta","permalink":"/blog/2021/07/26/software-templates-are-now-in-beta"},"nextItem":{"title":"How Spotify is helping more companies adopt Backstage","permalink":"/blog/2021/06/22/spotify-backstage-is-growing"}},"content":"![Backstage Search platform](assets/21-06-24/backstage-search-platform.png)\\n\\n**TLDR;** The new Backstage Search is now available in alpha, ready for you to start building on. A total rethinking of the core search feature in Backstage, it\u2019s more than just a box you type into \u2014 it\u2019s a mini platform all by itself. With its composable frontend and extensible backend, you can design and build the search tool that suits your organization\u2019s needs.\\n\\nSo, you don\u2019t just get an improved out-of-the-box experience for searching whatever is in your software catalog. You can also add support for searching other sources, too. Customize it the way you want and you can search your catalog, your plugins and docs \u2014 and even external sources, like Stack Overflow and Confluence \u2014 all at once, all right inside Backstage.\\n\\nWith one query, your teams can find exactly what they\u2019re looking for: anything and everything.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Search and explore\\n\\nBeing able to easily explore your ecosystem \u2014 to discover software, tools, documentation, and other valuable knowledge \u2014 is one of [the three main jobs of Backstage](https://backstage.io/blog/2021/05/20/adopting-backstage#three-jobs-create-manage-explore). Teams should be able to find what other teams have already built, so they can reuse and contribute to components instead of unknowingly duplicating them. Data endpoints should be shared, not siloed away. Services and their APIs should be easily discoverable. Best practices and technical documentation should be easily found.\\n\\nAlong with the [Backstage Service Catalog](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/06/22/backstage-service-catalog-alpha), Backstage Search is essential to enabling this discoverability \u2014 allowing new hires and old hands alike to explore your infrastructure instead of getting lost inside it.\\n\\nWe also quickly realized that search looks different from organization to organization. Therefore, we built a search platform that lets you plug in your own search engine, index any information you like, or build a customized search page experience that fits your users\u2019 needs.\\n\\nSince finding what you are looking for in Backstage is critical for success, we started by identifying the needs and goals of search.\\n\\n## Rethinking search, inside and out\\n\\nSpotify\u2019s internal version of Backstage has had some of the features of Backstage Search for a while, and open sourcing them has been top of mind since day one. But we didn\u2019t want to just port our internal version to the open source version. We wanted to take the opportunity to apply what we\u2019ve learned inside Spotify over the last year, address the needs we\u2019ve observed in the community, and ultimately open source not just a search feature but a search platform. We started the process by looking at the [jobs to be done](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done).\\n\\n![Backstage Search platform](assets/21-06-24/jobs-to-be-done.png)\\n_A high-level overview of the process, identifying all the jobs of search._\\n\\nFirst, we looked at which jobs to be done belonged to the search plugin itself (e.g., \u201Ccollect documents to index\u201D) and which belonged to the other plugins (e.g., \u201Cformat documents for indexing\u201D), and then whether those jobs belonged to the frontend (\u201Cdisplay results\u201D) or the backend (\u201Cschedule indexing\u201D).\\n\\nLooking at all these various jobs, we defined four goals for the platform:\\n\\n- **Flexibility:** Be search engine\u2013agnostic\\n- **Simplicity:** Make it easy for content owners to make their content searchable/discoverable\\n- **Control:** Allow plugin developers to customize their search results components\\n- **Reusability:** Offer reusable components/APIs that other devs can leverage\\n\\nBeginning our journey this way \u2014 by identifying the jobs to be done first, then defining the product goals from there \u2014 we could make sure that the search platform addressed real needs and improved the search experience for both users and plugin developers.\\n\\nThis approach not only created a better search tool for the open source community, but for Spotify, as well. So, instead of just open sourcing our internal version of search, we ended up with an even better solution \u2014 one that we can all use and build on together, both inside and outside Spotify.\\n\\n## Say hello to the Backstage Search platform\\n\\n![Backstage Search platform](assets/21-06-24/search-results.png)\\n\\nWe are now happy and proud to announce our alpha version of the [Backstage Search Platform](https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/architecture), featuring:\\n\\n- Bring your own search engine (Flexibility)\\n- Collators for easily indexing content from plugins and other sources (Simplicity)\\n- Composable search page experiences (Control, Reusability)\\n- Customize the look and feel of each search result (Control, Reusability)\\n\\n### Bring your own search engine\\n\\nBy introducing a Search Integration Layer, we have been able to keep the query translation of the search term and filters close to the search engine itself. This makes our search backend less focused on how a set of terms and filters should be translated to fit a certain search engine interface and more focused on querying and retrieving results as well as collecting results to index.\\n\\nWith the Search Integration Layer, your organization can bring your search engine of choice to Backstage \u2014 instead of relying on Backstage to support a specific search engine that might not fit the needs of your organization, either today or in the future.\\n\\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean \u201Cbatteries not included\u201D. The current version of Backstage Search ships with Lunr support built-in \u2014 and support for ElasticSearch is not very far off. And we hope the number of supported search engines will continue to grow with the community\u2019s help.\\n\\n### Collators for easily indexing content from plugins and other sources\\n\\nSince Backstage\u2019s functionality comes from its plugins, we wanted the process of making plugin content searchable to be as frictionless as possible. Therefore we decided on a concept we call collators. Collators are responsible for collecting documents to index from a plugin. Your collators live inside your own plugin, but are registered in the Backstage app\u2019s search backend.\\n\\nCollators can also be used to index external sources, like Stack Overflow and Confluence. You can watch a demo of how easy it is to extend search with collators [here](https://youtu.be/Z78FFaObTfk?t=339).\\n\\n### Composable search page experiences\\n\\nEvery engineering org has different needs \u2014 that is something we have definitely learned over the last year. Your software catalog might be set up differently than ours and therefore your needs for how search results look and how the search filters work will also differ.\\n\\nThat\'s why we have put effort into making your search page experience composable to your organization\'s needs. What do we mean by that? When you adopt Backstage and set up your app, you can set up \u2014 or, compose \u2014 your search page by using existing components or by creating your own custom ones.\\n\\n### Customize the look and feel of each search result\\n\\nA good example of the level of customization the platform allows is how list items are displayed in search results. A search result component can be a list, this list can consist of different list items (search results returned from the search engine) \u2014 but these list items could look different depending on what the search result returns in terms of its fields.\\n\\nLet\u2019s say that for an entity returned from the software catalog maybe the most important information to show is the name, while a result returned from the TechDocs plugin should maybe show the text content as the most important information. This can be customized by creating `<CustomResultListItem />` components (like `TechDocsResultListItem` or `CatalogResultListItem` or whatever list item component you want) and configuring them in the app.\\n\\nIf there is no need to customize your search result list items, the `<DefaultResultListItem />` component is there for you to reuse.\\n\\n## Getting started with Backstage Search\\n\\nWe put together [a getting started guide](https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/getting-started) that provides two different ways to set up Backstage Search:\\n\\n- Create a new app and get the most out of the search setup right out of the box, or\\n- Add the new Backstage Search setup to your existing Backstage app.\\n\\nWhichever situation you\u2019re in, we have you covered.\\n\\n## What\u2019s next?\\n\\nWe\u2019ve built the foundation for the Backstage Search platform, and we can\'t wait to see the exciting engines, collators, and components the community builds on the platform.\\n\\nYou can check out our [project roadmap](https://backstage.io/docs/features/search/#project-roadmap) in our search documentation or track the progress of our [Beta milestone](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/27) and [GA milestone](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/28).\\n\\nFor any questions, feedback or ideas about the Backstage Search platform, join us in the #search channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673)!"},{"id":"/2021/06/22/spotify-backstage-is-growing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/06/22/spotify-backstage-is-growing","source":"@site/blog/2021-06-22-spotify-backstage-is-growing.mdx","title":"How Spotify is helping more companies adopt Backstage","description":"The Backstage community is growing!

In just over [a year](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/03/happy-birthday-backstage-spotifys-biggest-open-source-project-grows-up-fast/), Backstage has gone from a few open source building blocks to a thriving platform used by engineering orgs with thousands of developers. But even with 30+ [adopting companies](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md) and 400+ contributors, we are still in the very early stages of reaching the platform\u2019s potential.\\n\\nIn order to grow Backstage further, Spotify is increasing the support we provide both adopters (the people integrating Backstage into their organizations) and contributors (the people building features and improving the code). The more companies that adopt Backstage, the more support the project gets, the stronger the platform becomes for everyone.\\n\\nAnd while Spotify remains committed to maturing the Backstage platform \u2014 both as original creator and active maintainer \u2014 we also want to make room for the community to take greater ownership. Backstage may have started inside Spotify, but it belongs to all of you. So, we hope you join us in what\u2019s next.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## What\u2019s next: More support for adopters and contributors\\n\\nAlongside the code contributions, technical support, and community leadership provided by our dedicated (and still growing) Backstage team, Spotify is introducing three additional ways to help lower the barriers to adopting the platform:\\n\\n1. **New consulting support.** In addition to investing in the Backstage getting started experience and the technical support we already provide, we\u2019re adding [consulting support](https://backstage.spotify.com) for companies who are looking to adopt (or are already in the middle of adopting) Backstage.\\n2. **Double the community sessions.** We are creating separate meetups for Backstage adopters and Backstage contributors for more focused discussions. (Come to both!)\\n3. **Adding reviewers and maintainers.** We recently introduced [reviewers](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/5137) to the Backstage project to speed up PR reviews and approvals, with the hope of also adding more maintainers in the future.\\n\\n## Why Spotify is increasing its investment in open source (and why now)\\n\\nBefore we talk in more detail about these new efforts, why is Spotify doing this? The short answer is the same answer as when we released the very first open source version of Backstage: we envision Backstage as the standard developer portal platform across the industry.\\n\\n### Setting the standard, both inside and outside Spotify\\n\\nWe believe in Backstage \u2014 we believe in the developer experience it provides, the developer-centric culture it encourages, and the immense value that the open source community brings to it. It is no exaggeration to say that we depend on Backstage every day at Spotify. It\u2019s the central hub for our internal R&D community, and it\u2019s both mission-critical to our daily operations and our future growth.\\n\\n### We\u2019re an adopter, too\\n\\nWe (that includes Spotify\u2019s leadership, as well as our platform teams and dedicated Backstage team) also believe that Backstage\u2019s continued success here \u2014 inside Spotify \u2014 depends on its success out here \u2014 in the wider open source community, where Backstage can reach its full potential. Like other adopters, we\u2019re fully invested in the platform\u2019s growth.\\n\\n### An open platform is the strongest platform\\n\\nWe genuinely believe that the best platform for developers can only be shaped by the most diverse group of developers. Each new adopter and every new contributor brings unique perspectives and experiences to the challenges of improving developer experience and effectiveness. As the project scales \u2014 and progresses toward CNCF graduation \u2014 we need to make more room in the community for both adopters and contributors.\\n\\nSo, let\u2019s get to it.\\n\\n## Consulting support (and a new website) for adopters\\n\\n[![Who else is using Backstage? Netflix, Zalando, TELUS, DoorDash, more](assets/21-06-22/spotify-backstage-adopters.png)](https://backstage.spotify.com/)\\n\\nWe\u2019ve launched a new website at: [backstage.spotify.com](https://backstage.spotify.com). It\u2019s a hub for new and potential adopters to receive support from Spotify and our Preferred Partners. The site is focused on helping organizations get up and running with Backstage by addressing their unique needs and use cases.\\n\\nYou\u2019ll find a high-level introduction to the platform, tips and tricks tested by Spotify to accelerate developer effectiveness, and access to a group of partners that have scaled Backstage for numerous adopters. You can also use the site to book product overviews, demos, and technical deep dives with members of the Spotify team.\\n\\nWe will continue to post important product announcements, technical documentation, feature demos, and community news here on Backstage.io. ([Subscribe to the newsletter](https://spoti.fi/backstagenewsletter) to stay up to date.) And both contributors and adopting companies can continue to find around-the-clock/around-the-world technical support on [GitHub](https://github.com/backstage/backstage) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673).\\n\\n## Separate community sessions for adopters and contributors\\n\\n[![Backstage Community Sessions, hosted by Spotify](assets/21-06-22/backstage-community-sessions.png)](https://github.com/backstage/community/#backstage-community)\\n\\nEarlier this year, we began hosting [Backstage Community Sessions](https://github.com/backstage/community/#backstage-community) \u2014 official meetups for anyone who wanted to join them. Since [the very first one](https://youtu.be/4-VX9tDdJYY), the Backstage team has been inspired and humbled by the community\u2019s participation in these sessions \u2014 from hearing the [Expedia Group team share their journey adopting Backstage](https://youtu.be/rRphwXeq33Q?t=1509) to discussions about TypeScript and Material UI. It\u2019s great collaborating through code \u2014 but it\u2019s also a lot of fun when you can see each other\u2019s faces and have a conversation.\\n\\nAnd while these sessions have been a success, the feedback we\u2019ve gotten from the community has been very clear: more frequent and more focused conversations. So, later this summer, we\u2019ll be launching standalone Backstage Adopter Sessions and Backstage Contributor Sessions. We hope this will lead to more useful sessions for everyone \u2014 and, of course, you are welcome to attend either or both:\\n\\n- **For the adopter sessions:** we invite you to share the challenges, learnings, and use cases you\u2019re facing with companies similar to yourselves.\\n- **For the contributor sessions:** we invite you to share thoughts, suggestions, and gaps in the Backstage core with the maintainers and reviewers.\\n\\nSpeaking of reviewers and maintainers\u2026\\n\\n## Adding reviewers and maintainers\\n\\n[![GitHub logo](assets/21-06-22/gh-reviewers.png)](https://github.com/backstage/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#reviewers)\\n\\nWe have introduced [reviewers](https://github.com/backstage/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#reviewers) to the project! By adding this new role, we\u2019ve expanded the number of people who are permitted to approve and merge pull requests. This will offload some of the review work from the maintainers, simplifying and speeding up the review process for contributors.\\n\\nOf course, with these new efforts, we expect even more companies to adopt Backstage, which means the platform will continue to grow, and the number of PRs will continue to grow with it. As that happens, we hope to add to both the maintainer and reviewer teams in the future.\\n\\nSo, I\u2019ll end this post as it began: the Backstage community is growing! And we look forward to growing even bigger, even faster, together."},{"id":"/2021/05/20/adopting-backstage","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/05/20/adopting-backstage","source":"@site/blog/2021-05-20-adopting-backstage.mdx","title":"Where do you start when adopting Backstage?","description":"Create, Manage, Explore","date":"2021-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":9.89,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Austin Lamon, Spotify","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/austinlamon","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Where do you start when adopting Backstage?","author":"Austin Lamon, Spotify","authorURL":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/austinlamon"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How Spotify is helping more companies adopt Backstage","permalink":"/blog/2021/06/22/spotify-backstage-is-growing"},"nextItem":{"title":"New Backstage feature: Kubernetes for Service owners","permalink":"/blog/2021/01/12/new-backstage-feature-kubernetes-for-service-owners"}},"content":"![Create, Manage, Explore](assets/21-05-20/create-manage-explore.gif)\\n\\nOne of the greatest strengths of Backstage also presents a never-ending challenge: Backstage is highly customizable and allows you to easily build a unique developer portal suited to your organization\u2019s needs. The downside of this flexibility is that it can be hard to know where to start. Backstage can do so many things \u2014 integrating every part of your tech infrastructure and developer experience \u2014 but if you set off building a developer portal without a plan, it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed by all the possibilities. To help you form your plan, this post will detail how Spotify came to design our internal portal and recommend potential models for you to use when designing and building your own.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Infrastructure as tech culture\\n\\nBefore providing recommendations on getting started with Backstage, it\u2019s helpful to have a bit of context as to why Spotify made the design decisions we did. No two companies are identical \u2014 and thus, no two Backstage implementations are the same.\\n\\nRolling back the clock just a few years, [Spotify was challenged](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/05/a-product-story-the-lessons-of-backstage-and-spotifys-autonomous-culture/) to continue to scale our engineering team (and the number of features and components built) but retain the speed of product development. Some user research with Spotify developers highlighted a clear problem: there was simply too much non-documented institutional knowledge needed to get things done. No one could find anything and everyone was interrupting everyone else trying to figure things out.\\n\\nSpotify\u2019s developers were facing three big challenges on a daily basis:\\n\\n- They not only needed to build software quickly, they also needed to pass along knowledge to new joiners about how best to create new components.\\n- They needed to somehow maintain a mental model of the systems their squad owned. (Or, if they were lucky, they found a hopefully-up-to-date spreadsheet tracking this information.)\\n- They needed to keep an eye on what squads around them might be building to ensure they could reuse systems when they needed to solve similar problems in the future.\\n\\nIn short, Spotify developers needed to continue building industry leading features at breakneck speed, while simultaneously maintaining a mental model for all the software at Spotify (oh, and help every new joiner develop that mental model as well!).\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n## Three jobs: Create, manage, explore\\n\\nAround the same time, the [jobs to be done](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done) framework was becoming popular and luckily, a few Spotifiers helped guide the vision for a _sense-making tool for developers_ toward using it. After user research and many failed attempts, we landed on three jobs Spotify developers needed to do consistently:\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n- **Create**: Spotify developers want to delight their customers with incredible features. They create new software to do that.\\n- **Manage**: Spotify developers are proud of their work and treat their software and data like products. That requires maintaining all the software they own on an ongoing basis.\\n- **Explore**: Spotify developers want to solve new, yet unsolved problems. They try to build on existing systems to help them do that.\\n\\nSo: make software, maintain the software you own throughout its lifecycle, and integrate with other people\u2019s software.\\n\\nWithin today\u2019s complex development environments, there are barriers both big and small that get in the way of those three jobs. Backstage provides the building blocks for removing those barriers, streamlining your development cycle, and letting developers do what they really want to do: build great features. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of these jobs.\\n\\n![Backstage Software Templates rocket](assets/21-05-20/create.gif)\\n\\n### Create\\n\\n**Job:** You\u2019re an engineer, ready to start building a new microservice. Do you just pick whatever framework you want? How do you reserve capacity to run your service in production? What about managing CI/CD?\\n\\n**Tool:** At Spotify, we use **Backstage Software Templates** to simplify all of this, reducing time\u2013to\u2013Hello World to just a few clicks. Instead of researching Spring Boot versus Helidon, opening a Jira ticket, rummaging through docs, and configuring CI automations, you just choose a template and your project is automatically set up in the repo for you, with the CI already running your first build.\\n\\n**Result:** By making it easier to start new projects, your engineers get to the good part of coding features faster. And your organization\u2019s best practices are built into the templates, encouraging standards and reducing complexity in your tech ecosystem.\\n\\n![Backstage Service Catalog system](assets/21-05-20/manage.gif)\\n\\n### Manage\\n\\n**Job:** You\u2019re on a small team that owns a dozen services. Whenever you update and deploy those services, you\u2019re switching between your CI, the AWS console, a security dashboard, and a CLI so you can try to figure out which Kubernetes cluster your service ended up on. In other words, you have a lot of open windows and tabs, and each step means switching to a new interface.\\n\\n**Tool:** All of your team\u2019s software components are organized together on one page in the **Backstage Service Catalog**. Go to any service\u2019s page from there and its CI/CD status, [Kubernetes deployment status](https://backstage.io/blog/2021/01/12/new-backstage-feature-kubernetes-for-service-owners), documentation, security checks \u2014 and everything else related to that service \u2014 is grouped together in one seamless interface that shows you only the info you want.\\n\\n**Result**: One page in Backstage has everything you need to manage the software you own. No more context-switching. No more digging through your cloud provider\u2019s obscure admin features. Outside the repo and your IDE, everything you need to manage your service is right inside Backstage.\\n\\n![Backstage explorer](assets/21-05-20/explore.gif)\\n\\n### Explore\\n\\n**Job:** You\'re building a new mobile feature that needs to ensure a user is paying for the premium version of your product \u2014 but someone must\u2019ve already built a library that handles that, right? A company-wide email and a few calls for help on Slack yield no response, so you resign yourself to building the capability yourself. Turns out someone did build the library you needed. They were just on vacation so they didn\u2019t see your messages. How do you enable better discovery and collaboration across your org?\\n\\n**Tools:** At Spotify, anyone can find everyone else\u2019s software \u2014 because everything is centralized inside Backstage, organized by the **Backstage Service Catalog** and accessible by **search**. Go to any library or services page, and you\u2019ll find the owners and documentation, even its API and how to extend it if need be.\\n\\n**Result:** One place for everything, one place to search. Developers can more easily share components, build on top of each other\u2019s work, and discover tools, libraries, frameworks, documentation, system designs, org charts, and more.\\n\\n## Sounds great. Where do I start?\\n\\nAfter talking with companies who have already adopted Backstage, we\u2019ve seen a few common strategies for getting started. The different strategies are based on the size of your engineering org (which often also corresponds with how fast you\u2019re growing).\\n\\n![200 engineers](assets/21-05-20/200-engineers_v.2.png)\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n### My org has ~200 engineers (and is growing fast)\\n\\nYou\u2019re big enough to start feeling the pain, and only getting bigger. Onboarding and discoverability are your biggest challenges.\\n\\n**Pain points:**\\n\\n- This size seems to be the tipping point \u2014 where complexity is taking hold, collaboration starts breaking down, and ad hoc solutions stop working.\\n- Often this is also when you\u2019re growing so fast (doubling in size every 6\u201312 months) that there are now more new engineers than old engineers.\\n- New engineers can\u2019t find anything, so they ask around, which pulls all your other engineers off-task with interruptions.\\n- Logjams form. One company told us how it was taking 3\u20134 days for pull requests to get merged.\\n\\n**Recommendation \u2014 Explore, then create:**\\n\\n- New engineers need an easy way to find out how to do things, so you\u2019re not just adding bodies, you\u2019re adding happy, productive contributors.\\n- To streamline onboarding, start with centralizing your documentation and making your tools and software components discoverable in Backstage.\\n- At this size, you might not have a dedicated platform/infra team in place yet, but Backstage can provide the framework for centralizing and sharing knowledge \u2014 from managing compliance requirements to finding the right API documentation.\\n- This allows both new and old engineers to collaborate more efficiently, easily discover best practices, and cuts down on duplicated work (e.g., a new team doesn\u2019t end up rebuilding a database that already exists but nobody can find).\\n\\n![1,000 engineers](assets/21-05-20/1000-engineers_v.2.png)\\n\\n### My org has ~1,000 engineers\\n\\nYou\u2019re officially big. Lots and lots of teams are managing lots and lots of software \u2014 and the frustration of switching between all the various tools to do that is growing exponentially.\\n\\n**Pain points:**\\n\\n- Fragmentation and entropy are real threats to productivity. From security requirements to cluster management to a thousand data endpoints, there\u2019s too much to keep track of, leading to cognitive overload.\\n- A death by a thousand cuts: constantly logging into new interfaces \u2014 from your cloud provider\u2019s console to some brand new security tool then back to your CI/CD \u2014 is bogging your engineers down with too much context-switching and a lot of noise.\\n- Every day, it\u2019s getting more and more difficult for one team to manage their own microservices, data, and documentation, let alone share their knowledge with other teams.\\n\\n**Recommendation \u2014 Manage, then explore, then create:**\\n\\n- Backstage will allow your teams to get a handle on the software they own, since everything they need to manage it is in one place.\\n- From CI/CD status to documentation to deciphering a monorepo, Backstage makes it easy to manage a service (or other software component) on a day-to-day basis.\\n- The service catalog also helps your developers visualize your existing software ecosystem, beyond the software they own. And with Backstage Software Templates, every new software component is already added to the catalog.\\n- Even at this scale, a small platform team should be all it takes to build and maintain your own version of Backstage. At Spotify, we have a 4-person team responsible for our internal version of Backstage, which is used by all of Spotify\u2019s 1,600+ developers.\\n\\n![More than 1,000 engineers](assets/21-05-20/1000-plus-engineers_v.2.png)\\n\\n### My org has 1,000+ engineers\\n\\nIntegrating infrastructure of this size and complexity can seem overwhelming. It\u2019s an even bigger challenge to bring this level of change to a well-established culture with ingrained processes.\\n\\n**Pain points:**\\n\\n- When you\u2019re this large, you\u2019ve incorporated a lot of technology and processes, as well as a lot of partners, each with their own technologies and processes.\\n- You\u2019re focussed on \u201Creplacing cruft\u201D and bringing discoverability and order to your vast ecosystem of components and tools.\\n- Getting your tools adopted by your engineers while modernizing your tech stack and coordinating with your infra teams to improve your engineering practices across the whole company\u2026 it\u2019s a lot.\\n\\n**Recommendation \u2014 Create, then manage, then explore:**\\n\\n- The fastest way to bring change to your ecosystem is to start at the beginning of the chain with Backstage Software Templates.\\n- With every new component created with your templates, you\u2019re establishing best practices and rewarding your developers with a streamlined experience focused on their needs \u2014 all the while building up your new service catalog.\\n- The more the templates ease the process of starting up a project, the more your engineers will adopt them, and the faster the other benefits of Backstage will build up, transforming productivity across your organization. ([That\u2019s how we did it at Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7iuQ3ew1Wwpuiq6LbBKzCl).)\\n\\n## More questions about adopting Backstage?\\n\\n[Contact the Backstage team at Spotify.](https://backstage.spotify.com/) We\u2019ll share more about what we\u2019ve learned from our experience here at Spotify \u2014 and from other companies who are already using Backstage to transform their developer experience."},{"id":"/2021/01/12/new-backstage-feature-kubernetes-for-service-owners","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/01/12/new-backstage-feature-kubernetes-for-service-owners","source":"@site/blog/2021-01-12-new-backstage-feature-kubernetes-for-service-owners.mdx","title":"New Backstage feature: Kubernetes for Service owners","description":"Animation of Kubernetes and cloud provider icons becoming the Backstage logo","date":"2021-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.86,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Clarke, Spotify","url":"https://github.com/mclarke47","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"New Backstage feature: Kubernetes for Service owners","author":"Matthew Clarke, Spotify","authorURL":"https://github.com/mclarke47"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Where do you start when adopting Backstage?","permalink":"/blog/2021/05/20/adopting-backstage"},"nextItem":{"title":"Announcing the Backstage Stability Index","permalink":"/blog/2020/12/22/stability-index"}},"content":"![Animation of Kubernetes and cloud provider icons becoming the Backstage logo](assets/21-01-12/backstage-k8s-1-hero.gif)\\n\\nTLDR; We\u2019re rethinking the Kubernetes developer experience with a new feature: a Kubernetes monitoring tool that\u2019s designed around the needs of service owners, not cluster admins. Now developers can easily check the health of their services no matter how or where those services are deployed \u2014 whether it\u2019s on a local host for testing or in production on dozens of clusters around the world.\\n\\nAnd since Backstage uses the native Kubernetes API, the feature works with whichever cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) or managed service (OpenShift, IBM Cloud, GKE, etc.) you already use.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## The missing link between K8s and your service\\n\\nA core feature of Backstage is its service catalog, which aggregates information about software systems together inside a single tool, with a consistent, familiar UI.\\n\\nBy navigating to a service\u2019s overview page in Backstage, you can see everything you need to know about the service: what it does, its APIs and technical documentation, CI/CD progress \u2014 and now detailed information about its presence on Kubernetes clusters.\\n\\n## No more context switching\\n\\nKubernetes in Backstage can be configured to search multiple clusters for your services. It will then aggregate them together into a single view. So if you deploy to multiple clusters you will no longer need to switch kubectl contexts to understand the current state of your service.\\n\\n![List of deployments in Backstage Kubernetes plugin](assets/21-01-12/backstage-k8s-2-deployments.png)\\n\\n## Automatic error reporting\\n\\nInstead of trying different kubectl commands to figure out where an error occurred, Backstage will automatically find and highlight errors in Kubernetes resources that are affecting your service. So you can spend time fixing errors, not hunting for them.\\n\\n![Error reporting screen in Backstage Kubernetes plugin](assets/21-01-12/backstage-k8s-3-error-reporting.png)\\n\\n## Autoscaling limits at a glance\\n\\nBackstage also shows you how close your service is to its autoscaling limit. Coming up to a period of high load? Now you will be able to see how your horizontal autoscaling is dealing with it across multiple clusters.\\n\\n![Autoscaling limits screen in Backstage Kubernetes plugin](assets/21-01-12/backstage-k8s-4-autoscaling-limits.png)\\n\\n![Autoscaling limits screen in Backstage Kubernetes plugin](assets/21-01-12/backstage-k8s-5-autoscaling-limits.png)\\n\\n## Pick a cloud, any Cloud\\n\\nSince Backstage communicates directly with the Kubernetes API, it\u2019s cloud agnostic \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter how or where you\u2019re running Kubernetes. You\u2019ll always get the same familiar view of your deployments, whether you\u2019re:\\n\\n- Deploying to clusters on AWS, Azure, GCP, or another cloud provider\\n- Using an unmanaged or managed Kubernetes service (like OpenShift, etc.)\\n- Migrating from one cloud provider or service to another\\n- Testing on a single local machine or deploying to a dozen clusters in production\\n\\nIn short: local or global, single or multi-cloud, managed or unmanaged \u2014 Backstage always provides a seamless Kubernetes experience for your service owners\u2019 day-to-day development needs.\\n\\n## Rethinking the developer experience\\n\\nThe philosophy behind Backstage is simple: improve developer experience by reducing infrastructure complexity. As popular and widespread as Kubernetes has become, all of the tools to date have been geared toward the needs of cluster admins. These tools add unnecessary complexity to the workflows of the typical developer building, testing, and deploying services.\\n\\nWe believe Backstage Kubernetes gives developers back control of their services by providing a more focused and consistent experience. Backstage provides a single standard for developers to monitor their Kubernetes deployments, regardless of the underlying cloud infrastructure.\\n\\n## Future iterations\\n\\nThe current focus of Kubernetes in Backstage is Deployments/ReplicaSets/Pods \u2014 but we know that not everyone utilizes these.\\n\\nAs we continue to grow and develop Kubernetes in Backstage with the community, we hope to offer support for Kubernetes resources beyond Deployments and Custom Resource Definitions. You can browse or add open issues for the plugin [here].\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\nWe made the Kubernetes plugin a core feature of Backstage. Like Software Templates (scaffolder) and TechDocs, the k8s-plugin is installed with the core app. When you update the app to the latest version and go to the Kubernetes tab of any service, you will be asked to provide your cloud provider credentials. To learn more, including details on configuration and surfacing your Kubernetes components as part of an entity, [read the docs].\\n\\nTo contribute or get more information on Kubernetes in Backstage, [join the discussion on Discord]!\\n\\n[here]: https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+kubernetes+label%3Ak8s-plugin\\n[read the docs]: https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/overview\\n[join the discussion on discord]: https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673"},{"id":"/2020/12/22/stability-index","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/12/22/stability-index","source":"@site/blog/2020-12-22-stability-index.mdx","title":"Announcing the Backstage Stability Index","description":"2022-01 update: The stability is now replaced by the versioning policy.","date":"2020-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.96,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Patrik Oldsberg, Spotify","url":"https://github.com/Rugvip","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Announcing the Backstage Stability Index","author":"Patrik Oldsberg, Spotify","authorURL":"https://github.com/Rugvip"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"New Backstage feature: Kubernetes for Service owners","permalink":"/blog/2021/01/12/new-backstage-feature-kubernetes-for-service-owners"},"nextItem":{"title":"New Cost Insights plugin: The engineer\u2019s solution to taming cloud costs","permalink":"/blog/2020/10/22/cost-insights-plugin"}},"content":"2022-01 update: The stability is now replaced by the [versioning policy](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/versioning-policy).\\n\\n**TL;DR** Backstage is heading out of alpha and moving onto the path to stable releases and an eventual version 1.0. As the community and ecosystem continue to grow at an increasing rate, we want to provide a solid foundation for everyone building things in, with, and around Backstage. So, today we\u2019re introducing the [Stability Index](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/versioning-policy) \u2014 a simple way to find out how likely (or unlikely) a specific package or plugin inside Backstage might be updated with major changes. By indicating the reliability of key features and APIs, this quick reference will help contributors and adopters better plan and coordinate their development efforts going forward.\\n\\n![Animation cycling between stability index scores](assets/2020-12-22/stability-index-hero.gif)\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nBackstage has a great and growing community of users and contributors. With so much valuable feedback, this inevitably means that sometimes we will go back and revise design decisions that introduce breaking changes. Furthermore, as we continue to ship new features and systems, we\u2019ll continue this cycle of iterating, gathering feedback, and iterating again before reaching a stable API.\\n\\nThis rapid evolution can create uncertainty around which parts of the project are considered stable and which are not. Regardless of whether you\'re contributing to the project directly, setting up your own Backstage, or building plugins, you will be using various parts of the project that vary in stability. While many API surfaces of Backstage are reasonably solid and are unlikely to see any big breaking changes, others are more unstable or experimental.\\n\\n## The Stability Index\\n\\nIn order to tackle the problem of uncertainty, and help align contributors, we have recently introduced a Stability Index. Inspired by a [similar concept with the same name in Node.js](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v4.x/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index), it\u2019s a score assigned to subsets of the project, indicating the level of maturity of the API and the commitment to backwards compatibility. However, because of the current phase of the project, we have used a slightly different implementation. Rather than the score indicating a perceived stability, a higher score is instead a commitment to providing a smoother upgrade path for users, both through better documentation and backwards compatibility. Importantly, the Stability Index does not supersede [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (or semver), meaning we will still adhere to semver and only do breaking changes in minor releases as long as we are on 0.x.\\n\\nYou can find more details about the scores on the [Stability Index](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/versioning-policy) page, but the following is a TL;DR of the 0\u20133 scores:\\n\\n- **0** \u2014 There\'s a changelog entry.\\n- **1** \u2014 There\'s a migration guide.\\n- **2** \u2014 Two weeks of deprecation.\\n- **3** \u2014 Three months of deprecation.\\n\\nThe Stability Index has been tailored for the phase that the project is currently in, and we do not intend to keep it in place in its current form forever. It is, for example, likely that we in the future will increase the deprecation time limits.\\n\\n## Staying up to date\\n\\nIn addition to the Stability Index, we have also recently adopted a weekly release cadence where we cut new releases every Thursday. Along with the two-week deprecation period of many of the API surfaces in Backstage, there is an excellent opportunity to form a routine to update your own Backstage projects either weekly or biweekly.\\n\\nIn order to make the update process easier, we\u2019ve added a new command to the Backstage CLI that allows you to easily update your project to use the latest Backstage release. The command is called `version:bump` and is executed in the root of your project using the CLI. You can see what it looks like in action below.\\n\\n![Output of the `backstage-cli` `version:bump` command](assets/2020-12-22/versions-bump.png)\\n\\n## Impact\\n\\nThe Stability Index has already been active for a couple of weeks, and we have immediately seen an impact on the consideration and care taken when working in parts of the project that we have committed to keeping more stable. Both members of the core maintainer team and contributors from the community have taken care to roll out updates responsibly, with examples such as [PR #3524](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/3524) and [PR #3465](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/3465).\\n\\nThe core team is working hard to bring more stability to broader parts of Backstage, and engineering it in a way that allows for long-term evolution. There are more learnings to be discovered as we continue evolving Backstage, but we are confident that the Stability Index will allow for a clearer path and a smoother ride for everyone involved!"},{"id":"/2020/10/22/cost-insights-plugin","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/10/22/cost-insights-plugin","source":"@site/blog/2020-10-22-cost-insights-plugin.mdx","title":"New Cost Insights plugin: The engineer\u2019s solution to taming cloud costs","description":"How did Spotify save millions on cloud costs within a matter of months??

Nope, we\u2019re just letting engineers do what they do best, in the place that feels natural to them: inside Backstage.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Why put a cost management tool in the hands of engineers?\\n\\nEngineers are closest to the metal in terms of knowing why a specific feature, product, or service is using cloud resources. So they\u2019re in the best position to understand how costs impact ongoing development (and vice versa).\\n\\nIf you manage costs top-down from a 10,000-foot view of your cloud infrastructure, you\u2019re likely making decisions far removed from products, especially in larger organizations. Set a broad cost-cutting goal, and you could be creating unintended consequences \u2014 curtailing spending at the expense of growth or experimentation.\\n\\n## Ground-level intelligence, data-driven solutions\\n\\nOur hypothesis at Spotify was, if you bring spending data into an engineer\u2019s everyday development workflow, they\u2019ll naturally look for cost optimizations just like they look for any other optimization. And the cost optimizations will be more efficient and effective, because the decisions are informed at the ground level.\\n\\nThe problem is that most cloud platforms don\u2019t provide cost data at a granular enough level to make those decisions. And the bigger your organization (say, two-thousand-microservices and four-thousand-data-pipelines big, like Spotify), then the less you can attribute these large, fuzzy numbers to the right team, let alone a shipping product or internal service.\\n\\nThat\u2019s where Cost Insights comes in. Instead of making cost management and product development separate departments on the org chart, Backstage brings them together \u2014 with a level of detail and specificity engineers relate and respond to.\\n\\n## How to turn dollars into sense\\n\\nIt\u2019s not enough to make costs visible. To be useful, the numbers need to be relevant, relatable, and actionable. In other words, not just cost information, but insights. There are several ways the plugin puts data from your cloud provider in a more helpful context.\\n\\n### Use business metrics to evaluate costs\\n\\nCost Insights will show you trends at a glance and also let you compare costs quarter over quarter. More importantly, you can also evaluate costs against business metrics that you care most about. In the example below, should the upward slope shown in the first screen be cause for worry? Perhaps not \u2014 if you switch views, you\u2019ll see that cost per daily average user (DAU) is actually going down. Exactly what you hope to see as you scale.\\n\\n![Comparing costs to DAU](assets/20-10-22/cost-insights-1-dau.gif)\\n_(Note: Screens are examples; they do not show real data.)_\\n\\n### Illustrate costs with relatable, real-world comparisons\\n\\nIn addition to dollar amounts, Cost Insights allows teams to visualize and convert cost overages into more relatable terms. In the example below, we equate the growth in costs for virtual machine instances (100% increase) to developer time spent (about 1 engineer). We use this particular comparison in the plugin because we found it resonated with our own engineers \u2014 providing a useful perspective for spending increases. You can configure what the \u201Ccost of an engineer\u201D means to your organization. Or engineers can build in their own comparisons \u2014 cups of coffee, carbon offset credits, electric luxury vehicles \u2014 whatever makes costs more tangible for them.\\n\\n![Cost growth as engineering time](assets/20-10-22/cost-insights-2-engineer.png)\\n_(Note: Screens are examples; they do not show real data.)_\\n\\n### Tie spending to specific products and resources\\n\\nThe more detailed the cost data, the more relevant, actionable, and helpful it is. Cost Insights allows you to attribute costs to products and resources in a way that makes sense to your engineers. For example, here we see a breakdown of data processing costs by individual pipelines. This allows your team to target optimizations more precisely.\\n\\n![Data Processing costs by pipeline](assets/20-10-22/cost-insights-3-data.png)\\n_(Note: Screens are examples; they do not show real data.)_\\n\\n## Driving down costs without slowing down development\\n\\nWhen it comes to cutting costs, we actually want to guard against over-optimization. Growth and costs can go hand in hand. The trick is knowing when one is out of balance and needs addressing. Our product highlights when there\u2019s been a large increase in spending, so that engineers are thinking about cost only when they must and aren\u2019t distracted from their set goals and priorities.\\n\\nEngineers can then determine for themselves if the time invested in an optimization was valuable compared to the costs saved. Cost Insights puts the decision in our engineers\u2019 hands for them to choose when to focus on growth efforts and when to focus on cost. Control, as ever, remains with our developers, where we think it belongs.\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\nYou can begin working with the Cost Insights plugin today on [GitHub](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/cost-insights/plugins/cost-insights). We include an example client with static data in the expected format. The `CostInsightsApi` should talk with a cloud billing backend that aggregates billing data from your cloud provider.\\n\\nThe current release of Cost Insights includes:\\n\\n- Daily cost graph by team or billing account\\n- Cost comparisons against configurable business metrics (including an option for Daily Active Users)\\n- Insights panels \u2014 configurable for the cloud products your company uses\\n- Cost alerts and recommendations\\n- Selectable time periods for month-over-month or quarter-over-quarter comparisons\\n- Conversion of cost growth into \u201Ccost of average engineer\u201D to help optimization trade-off decisions\\n\\nOur hope is to help other companies translate their cloud cost in a relatable way for their engineers to better understand their impact and accurately identify their opportunities for optimizations.\\n\\nAnd if you\u2019re interested in contributing to our outstanding issues, you can find them in the issues queue, filtered under the [\u2018cost-insights\u2019 label](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/labels/cost-insights).\\n\\n## Ready for DevSecCostOpsPlus (and whatever\u2019s next)\\n\\nThere\u2019s DevOps, there\u2019s DevSecOps, and then there\u2019s Backstage: one frontend for all your infrastructure.

Design should never be an afterthought \u2014 we believe an elegant, cohesive UX is vital to what makes Backstage such a productive, end-to-end development environment.\\n\\nBackstage keeps engineers from getting lost inside the complexity of your infrastructure by bringing order to your software ecosystem (through the [service catalog](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/06/22/backstage-service-catalog-alpha)) and providing an abstraction layer on top of it. How that abstraction layer works is essential to how Backstage works. So we\u2019ve spent time figuring out how to make great design in Backstage easier to achieve for both designers and non-designers alike.\\n\\nSince making Backstage open source, we\u2019ve been able to host design studios and user interviews with teams outside Spotify to get feedback and collaborate on a design system, together. (And we\u2019re always keen on collaborating with more organizations.)\\n\\n![img](assets/Backstage-mural-DS.png)\\n_Screenshot of our design studio for Backstage Search, which included stakeholders inside and outside of Spotify._\\n\\nAs Backstage has gained traction, we\u2019ve seen the importance of creating a scalable and coherent design system. It\u2019s through the shared guidelines of our design system that we are able to maintain a unified ecosystem of plugins for our users, globally. Let\u2019s get started by taking a closer look at the different design components of a plugin.\\n\\n## Anatomy of a plugin\\n\\n![](https://backstage.io/img/cards-plugins.png)\\n\\nPlugins are what provide the feature functionality in Backstage, allowing you to customize it to fit your infrastructure. They are integrated into Backstage\'s frontend, so that no matter what tool or service is being accessed, users are guaranteed a seamless experience.\\n\\nAs you begin to [build your own plugins](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/), we encourage you to explore the [open source plugins](https://backstage.io/plugins) we have available in Backstage, as reference. The anatomy of a plugin is simple. In the example below, we\u2019ve highlighted a few of the standard components you should consider when designing your plugin.\\n\\n![img](assets/backstage-guide-DS.png)\\n\\n1. **Tabs.** Want to include multiple pages in your plugin? Use our tab component so users can easily navigate through your plugin.\\n2. **Title.** Plugin pages should always have a title. Subheads are optional. Typically, the \u2018star\u2019 icon is included in the overview tab, which allows the user to favorite the plugin, adding it to the side navigation.\\n3. **Cards.** Use the card components to display different kinds of content and functionality. You can follow our 12-column, responsive grid system to arrange the cards.\\n4. **Support.** There should always be a support button (tertiary style, with icon). There can also be a primary action button as well as a secondary one.\\n5. **Header.** Use the Backstage header to allow for users to easily understand what they\u2019re looking at. You can include an optional subhead as well as other information. The color varies depending on the type of plugin you\u2019ve built (stand-alone tool, service, app, website, etc.).\\n\\nNow that we\u2019ve familiarized ourselves with the basic parts of a plugin, let\u2019s take a look at some of the tools and resources that make designing plugins even easier.\\n\\n## Tools and resources\\n\\nThe quickest way to start is by duplicating our [Figma UI kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/850673348101741100), then clicking on the Create a Plugin page on the left-hand side to grab some templates. Feel free to experiment and play around! Figma is a fantastic, multiplayer tool that allows for designers and developers to co-create components and share specs with ease. We\u2019re excited to see what you design and develop.\\n\\nAs you\u2019re designing and building your plugins, make sure to take advantage of these helpful resources.\\n\\n![img](assets/backstage-figma1-DS.png)\\n![img](assets/backstage-figma2-ds.png)\\n\\n### [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/@backstage)\\n\\nWe are thrilled to be using [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/@backstage) to share our design assets. You can duplicate our UI kit and design your own plugin for Backstage. Figma Community is currently in beta, so this is a neat opportunity to be testing out a new way of working. At the moment, it doesn\u2019t support auto-updating of duplicated files, so we\u2019ll be announcing new versions of our UI kit on Discord in the #design channel.\\n\\n![img](assets/backstage-storybook-ds.png)\\n\\n### [Storybook](https://backstage.io/storybook/)\\n\\nYou can view (and grab) our [reusable components on Storybook](https://backstage.io/storybook/). If you\u2019d like to help build up our design system, you can also help us add components that we\u2019ve designed to Storybook as well. We post newly designed components and patterns to GitHub as issues, where contributors can pick them up and add them to our Storybook so they\u2019re available for the rest of the Backstage community.\\n\\n![img](assets/backstage-guidelines-ds.png)\\n\\n### [Guidelines](https://backstage.io/docs/dls/design)\\n\\nTo keep up with our latest design guidelines, go to [Designing for Backstage](https://backstage.io/docs/dls/design). You\u2019ll find more how-to\u2019s and you can also learn more about our design philosophy and practices there. Down the line, we plan on including more in-depth component rules in this section (i.e., dos/don\u2019ts, use cases, etc.).\\n\\n![img](assets/backstage-github-ds.png)\\n\\n### [GitHub](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)\\n\\nJoin in on the action [at backstage/backstage on GitHub](https://github.com/backstage/backstage) by submitting issues and opening pull requests for all things related to components and patterns in Backstage.\\n\\n![img](assets/backstage-discord-DS.png)\\n\\n### [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/MUpMjP2)\\n\\nAll design questions should be directed to the [#design](https://discord.com/channels/687207715902193673/696709358544879716) channel in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/MUpMjP2).\\n\\n## What\'s next for Backstage design\\n\\nThere are a lot of exciting things that we\u2019re envisioning for Backstage and open source design at Spotify. These include:\\n\\n- Expanding our Backstage Design System by building on the UI kit and component library in Figma and Storybook\\n\\n* Collaborating with more of our amazing contributors to ensure our Backstage Design System works for everyone\\n\\n* Featuring rad plugins that folks have created, using our design system, in our Figma Community space\\n\\n* Building up our Guidelines by continuing to creating robust design documentation\\n\\n* Ensuring that we maintain accessible practices throughout our experience\\n\\n![img](assets/backstage-world-DS.png)\\n\\n## Get involved\\n\\nDesigning in the open needs to be democratic and participatory, which is why we invite you to join in on the fun! There are a couple things you can do to get involved, such as:\\n\\n- **Build with us!** Are there components/plugins that you\u2019d like to see in Backstage? Feel free to create an example/prototype of what you\u2019re envisioning and create a UX component issue in our GitHub repo.\\n\\n- **Chat with us!** If you have questions, ideas, or puppy GIFs, feel free to reach out to us on Discord in the #design channel.\\n\\n- **Share with us!** One of our priorities is making Backstage more accessible, and we need your help. If you\u2019ve got A11Y insights and ideas on how we can improve our product, please let us know!\\n\\n- **Work with us!** We are hiring for product designers to work on Backstage. We strongly stand for breaking traditional pipelines and elevating our caliber by hiring the best folks who are underrepresented minorities in tech today. Keen on joining?

Our belief is that engineers should not have to be experts in various infrastructure tools or disciplines (e.g., machine learning or backend) to be productive. Infrastructure should be abstracted away, so that developers can spend more cycles building and testing, quickly and safely. Backstage unifies all your infrastructure tooling, services, and documentation to create a streamlined development environment from end to end.\\n\\nNow you may be thinking, \u201CYeah, sure, that sounds nice and all, but how does Backstage actually abstract away infrastructure?\u201D The short answer: [plugins](https://backstage.io/plugins).\\n\\n![plugins](https://backstage.io/img/cards-plugins.png)\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nThink of plugins as a mini version of an infrastructure tool or service \u2014 just the parts you need, made quick and easy. The advantage of using a Backstage plugin instead of a tool\u2019s dedicated UI is that all your infrastructure is packaged into a \u201Csingle pane of glass\u201D instead of being spread out like independently built \u201Cislands\u201D. Once you grow your infrastructure portfolio, the complexity really starts to add up. The Backstage plugin model allows you to add more tools without increasing the cognitive load for your users.\\n\\nOur goal for the plugin ecosystem is that anything can be a plugin. The definition of a plugin is flexible enough to allow you to expose pretty much any kind of infrastructure or software development tool as a plugin in Backstage. By following clear [design guidelines](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/09/30/backstage-design-system) we ensure the overall user experience stays consistent between plugins. If we all do our job well, the end user of Backstage does not see the boundaries between plugins. They are interacting with one consistent product \u2014 with many features.\\n\\n## Building an ecosystem\\n\\nImagine a not-so-distant future where you walk up to Backstage, install it in your environment, and then choose from a gallery of existing, open source plugins that serve and match whatever infrastructure and software development needs you have inside your company. That means you can get started with Backstage and see the gains of improved productivity within days, not months. That is our vision for the Backstage plugin ecosystem.\\n\\nRunning services on Kubernetes? There\u2019s a plugin for that. Using Snyk for security scanning? There\u2019s a plugin for that. Grafana, DataDog, or Rollbar for monitoring? There\u2019s a plugin for that. Using Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, or Travis CI? Pick the CI plugin of your choice. You get the picture. Regardless of your stack, there\u2019s a plugin that you can use.\\n\\nLike this vision? So do we! But we can\u2019t do it alone. We\u2019ll need your help. For this vision to come true, we need to foster a community where many companies and individual developers build and contribute their plugins. Having been [accepted into the CNCF Sandbox](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/09/23/backstage-cncf-sandbox) provides us with the groundwork and guidance to broaden the community even faster.\\n\\nThis grand vision is actually not that far off. Already today there is a growing ecosystem of Backstage plugins. To highlight all the amazing work that has been done by the community, and make it easier for Backstage adopters to see what plugins are available, we now have a Plugin Marketplace: [https://backstage.io/plugins](https://backstage.io/plugins)\\n\\n![marketplace](assets/marketplace.png)\\n\\n## Creating and suggesting new plugins\\n\\nNot all plugins you need will be open source. Every company has their own homegrown tooling. Building internal plugins lets you tailor your version of Backstage to be a perfect fit for your infrastructure and software development needs. If you end up [building plugins](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/create-a-plugin) that could be useful for other companies, please consider releasing them as open source and [add them to the Marketplace](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/add-to-marketplace).\\n\\nIf you start developing a plugin that you aim to release as open source, we suggest that you create a [new plugin Issue on the community plugins repo](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/issues/new/choose). This helps the community know what plugins are in development and opens up opportunities for collaboration. You can also use this process if you have an idea for a good plugin, but you need help building it.\\n\\nWe are really excited to see all the amazing plugins that have already been built, and look forward to seeing even more ideas and collaboration as the Backstage community continues to grow.\\n\\nWhat plugins would you like to see in the Plugin Marketplace?

We released the open source version of Backstage \u2018early\u2019. That was intentional. Because even though we\u2019ve been using Backstage internally for years, we wanted the open source version to be developed with input and contributions from the community. And that\u2019s exactly the product that\u2019s going into the [CNCF Sandbox](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/) today.\\n\\nBackstage\u2019s ability to simplify tooling and standardize engineering practices has attracted interest from other major tech companies, as well as airlines, auto manufacturers, investment firms, and global retailers. We know that Backstage solves a problem \u2014 infrastructure complexity \u2014 that\u2019s common to a lot of large and growing companies today. But different companies work differently, use particular toolsets, and have unique use cases. By making Backstage open source, we can build it with people working inside a variety of engineering organizations all over the world. It makes for a better product that serves a wider group of users (beyond that of Spotify\u2019s) and their needs.\\n\\nThe Backstage community is healthy and growing quickly. Over [130 people](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/graphs/contributors) have contributed to the project, and roughly 40% of pull requests are now coming from external, non-Spotify, contributors. With companies now deciding to [adopt Backstage](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md) we are also seeing a shift in the kinds of contributions we are getting from the community. It is truly amazing to see contributions to core parts of the platform as well as significant functionality additions through working [plugins](https://backstage.io/plugins).\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited to embark on this journey with the CNCF community. There\u2019s so much great tech being built here, and it\u2019s about time we share it to build even greater products, together. Entering into the CNCF Sandbox is just the first step. We are committed to working with the community to bring Backstage through the Incubation step, and finally all the way to becoming a Graduated, top-level project.\\n\\nThanks to everyone for your support so far.

Its popularity is evidence of something simple: We made documentation so easy to create, find, and use \u2014 people actually use it.\\n\\nWe are quite sure the main reason for the success of TechDocs is our docs-like-code approach \u2014 engineers write their technical documentation in Markdown files that live together with the code. During CI, a documentation site is created using MkDocs, and all sites are rendered centrally in a Backstage plugin. On top of the static documentation, we incorporate additional metadata about the documentation site \u2014 such as owner, open GitHub Issues, Slack support channel, and Stack Overflow Enterprise tags.\\n\\n![available-templates](assets/announcing-techdocs/docs-in-backstage.png)\\n\\nBut this is just one way to do it.

Feel free to add your own issues, of course.\\n\\n![available-templates](assets/announcing-techdocs/github-issues.png)\\n\\nWhat we have on GitHub so far is a first iteration of TechDocs that you can use end-to-end \u2014 in other words, from docs written in Markdown in GitHub to a published site on Backstage.\\n\\nMore specifically, with this first iteration, you can:\\n\\n- Run TechDocs locally and read documentation.\\n- Configure your entity (e.g. service, website) so that Backstage builds your documentation and serves it in TechDocs. Documentation is displayed on the Docs tab in the Service Catalog and on its own page.\\n- Get documentation set up for free in your project when you create a new component out of one of the non-experimental templates (labeled with recommended). If you are looking for a standalone documentation project, use the docs-template.\\n- Choose your own storage solution for the documentation.\\n- Define your own API to interface with your documentation solution.\\n\\nFor a full overview, including getting started instructions, check out our [TechDocs Documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/).\\n\\nBut before you go there, let me tell you a bit about the TechDocs story \u2014 and why we believe TechDocs is such a powerful yet simple solution for great documentation.\\n\\n## The TechDocs story\\n\\nHere is the TechDocs story. It\u2019s not an uncommon one (we have learned from many other companies).\\n\\nAbout a year and a half ago, we conducted a company-wide productivity survey. The third largest problem according to all our engineers? Not being able to find the technical information they needed to do their work. And it\u2019s not surprising. There was no standard way to produce and consume technical documentation, so teams were going their own way \u2014 using Confluence, Google Docs, README files, custom built websites, GitHub Pages, and so on and on. And those searching for information were left to hunt for it in all those different places until they found what they were looking for (if they ever did). Worse, if you did happen to find the documentation that you needed, there was no way to know whether the information was up-to-date or correct. In other words, there was no way to know whether you could trust what you found. We did have technical writers at the company, but they were mostly scattered across the company solving documentation problems within their own particular domain.\\n\\nSo this is the fertile soil on which TechDocs was built.\\n\\nAfter a Hack Week implementation attracted interest from high up in the company, we formed a cross-functional team made up of technical writers and engineers with the mission to solve internal technical documentation at Spotify. And we started to build TechDocs. We went for a docs-like-code approach, fiercely optimizing for engineers and engineering workflows. We also went for an opinionated approach, telling everybody: This is the standard way to do technical documentation at Spotify. The sense was that engineers appreciated a documentation solution that was in line with their workflow and, after all the frustration of multiple tools, were relieved to be told \u201Cthis is the way to do it\u201D.\\n\\nFor more information about this journey, take a look at my 20-minute talk from DevRelCon London from last December: [The Hero\u2019s Journey: How we are solving internal technical documentation at Spotify](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/garyniemen_how-we-are-solving-internal-technical-documentation-activity-6646078605594030080-4L31).\\n\\n## Key problem areas that we are solving\\n\\nWe have come a long way, fast \u2014 both in our implementation and in our thinking. Here are some of the key problem areas that we are addressing. Note that they are in various stages of implementation, and we won\u2019t be able to release everything within our minimum plugin. In fact, see this as an appetite taster. What we hope is that we can build together.\\n\\n### Stuck to unstuck\\n\\nVery early on, we decided that the main problem we were trying to solve was to help engineers (when using technical documentation) go from stuck to unstuck, and fast. This became our guiding principle. Is what we are building helping engineers get unstuck faster? From this, it follows that we need to promote quality documentation on the one hand, and provide a high level of discoverability on the other. One without the other is not going to cut it.\\n\\n### Feedback loops\\n\\nWhat we want to build is a thriving community of technical documentation creators, contributors, and readers. We want this because, we believe, this is the way to drive up the quality of the documentation. More readers, more feedback, more doc updates. And driving up the quality of the corpus of technical documentation leads to trust which in turn leads to more engagement and, hence, more of a thriving community.\\n\\nTo get this working, we recognised that we need to remove \u2018friction from the system\u2019 \u2014 we need to build in efficient feedback loops. For example, help engineers get their doc site up by providing documentation improvement hints and build information as close as possible to where they are already working. And for readers, make it easy to give feedback. And then for doc site owners, ensure that they are notified when there is feedback and incentivised to make the fix.\\n\\n![available-templates](assets/announcing-techdocs/feedback-loop1.png)\\n\\n![available-templates](assets/announcing-techdocs/feedback-loop2.png)\\n\\n### Trust\\n\\nHow do I know whether to trust this piece of documentation? This is a question we want to be able to answer for those using technical documentation in Backstage. It\u2019s not an easy nut to crack. It is almost, one could say, the hard problem of technical documentation. For example, some might say \u2018last updated\u2019 is a key factor. But what about stable, good quality documentation that has no need to be updated? What about page views? Yes, this is a good sign that the documentation is being found and viewed, but it doesn\u2019t say anything about whether the documentation can be trusted. How about a button: Did this documentation help? This is good, but will people use it? Will we get enough data to show trust? We have lofty ambitions of one day providing a trust score on the doc site informed by a super-intelligent algorithm. But we are not there yet. For now, we have landed on surfacing when the documentation was last updated, top five contributors, the support channel, owning team, and number of open GitHub Issues. But going forward we are definitely up for solving the hard problem. We think there\u2019s much more work to be done here and look forward to seeing ideas from the community.\\n\\n### Discoverability and search\\n\\nHow to find stuff? That is another big question. As mentioned above, it\u2019s all well and good having quality documentation, but it\u2019s no use whatsoever if you can\u2019t find it. If you know what you are looking for, then you can use a search engine. If you don\u2019t know what you are looking for, then you are going to need more \u2014 like a well designed information architecture, a user friendly browse experience, and even intelligent suggestions based on your role and what you have searched for previously.\\n\\nIn this problem area, we made use of Elasticsearch, the open source search engine that was already being used in Backstage, to implement documentation search across all documentation sites and per documentation site. In terms of discoverability, we implemented a documentation home page in Backstage that surfaces Spotify\u2019s most important documents and uses metrics to list the company\u2019s most used doc sites as well as the documentation equivalent of a \u201Cyour daily mix\u201D playlist.\\n\\n![available-templates](assets/announcing-techdocs/discover1.png)\\n\\n![available-templates](assets/announcing-techdocs/discover2.png)\\n\\nThere is much more to do in the area of discoverability and search.\\n\\n### Use case variations\\n\\nThe standard use case for TechDocs is: One component in Backstage equals one GitHub repository, equals one doc site. This use case comes in two flavours: the repository is a code repository with docs or a docs-only repository. Then, to meet the needs of one large part of the Spotify engineering organisation that uses monorepos (multi-component repositories), we added a third use case. We built an MkDocs plugin that enabled doc site creators to include documentation from doc folders in other parts of the repository. So this use case is: One main component in Backstage equals a monorepo with distributed documentation, equals one doc site.\\n\\nThese three use cases satisfy most of the needs, but we have had plenty of requests for additional use cases, for example, the ability to create multiple doc sites from a multi-component repository and the ability to create one doc site from documentation in multiple repositories.\\n\\n### Metrics\\n\\nThere are many good arguments for standardizing the way that technical documentation is produced and consumed. One of them is metrics. If we have one way of producing technical documentation (in our case, GitHub Enterprise) and one place where it shows up (in our case, Backstage), we are in a strong position to build up metrics that help all the various stakeholders \u2014 for example, us building TechDocs, teams creating documentation sites, and engineers trying to get unstuck. Just imagine how much harder this would be if technical documentation was produced and consumed in a plethora of places, such as Confluence, Google Docs, README files, custom web sites, and GitHub Pages.\\n\\nOne thing we have recently completed is a Manage page in Backstage for doc site owners. Here teams can see all the documentation that they own, the number of GitHub Issues per doc site or page, and last updated. We have also built a large dashboard using the open source analytics software Redash to inform our own product development process.\\n\\n![available-templates](assets/announcing-techdocs/metrics.png)\\n\\nAgain, there is a lot more that can be done in the area of metrics. Did I mention the trust score?\\n\\n### Code-like-docs\\n\\nCode-like-docs, what? Okay, it\u2019s just my little play on words. This is what I mean. One request that we keep getting is to be able to have code in the documentation fetched from and in sync with code in GitHub. In this way, you can avoid code in the documentation going stale. MkDocs does have an extension for this \u2014 but it has some limitations. For example, the code has to be in the /docs folder with the Markdown files. We are working on developing a wider and more flexible solution.\\n\\n### Golden Paths\\n\\nAt Spotify, we have the concept of [Golden Paths](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/) \u2014 one for each engineering discipline. My favourite definition of Golden Path is that it is the \u201Copinionated and supported path\u201D. Each Golden Path has an accompanying Golden Path tutorial that walks you through the opinionated and supported path.\\n\\nThe Golden Path tutorials are Spotify\u2019s most used and important documents and have shown themselves to be the most challenging to manage within a docs-like-code environment. One reason for this is that they are long, divided into many parts, and ownership is typically spread among many different teams. We have had to make use of GitHub codeowners to handle ownership and had to create datasets and data pipelines to be able to attach GitHub Issues to the specific parts or files that a team owns. Another challenge of the Golden Path tutorials is that parts are often dependent on other parts. We are just starting to look into how we can solve these dependency challenges in order to remove friction for engineers writing tutorial documentation.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSo that\u2019s it for now. As you can see, we have come a long way AND there is much more to do. We are looking forward to continuing our docs-like-code journey out in the open with new, enthusiastic technical documentation friends."},{"id":"/2020/08/05/announcing-backstage-software-templates","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/08/05/announcing-backstage-software-templates","source":"@site/blog/2020-08-05-announcing-backstage-software-templates.mdx","title":"Announcing Backstage Software Templates","description":"TL;DR Today we are announcing a new Backstage feature: Software Templates.

Simplify setup, standardize tooling, and deploy with the click of a button. Using automated templates, your engineers can spin up a new microservice, website, or other software component with your organization\u2019s best practices built-in, right from the start.\\n\\n<video width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" controls>\\n  <source src=\\"/video/software-templates.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Balancing autonomy and standardization\\n\\nAt Spotify, we\u2019ve always believed in the speed and ingenuity that comes from having autonomous development teams. But as we learned firsthand, the faster you grow, the more fragmented and complex your software ecosystem becomes. And then everything slows down again.\\n\\nBy centralizing services and standardizing your tooling, Backstage streamlines your development environment from end to end. Instead of restricting autonomy, standardization frees your engineers from infrastructure complexity. So you can return to building and scaling, quickly and safely.\\n\\nToday we are releasing one of the key features that helps balance autonomy and standardization: templates for creating software.\\n\\n## Backstage Software Templates: Push-button deployment\\n\\nBackstage Software Templates automate and standardize the process of creating software components. To show you how they work, we created four sample templates to get you started \u2014 just configure them to fit your tooling and off you go:\\n\\n- **Create React App Template** \u2014 create a new CRA website project\\n- **Golang Microservice** \u2014 create a Golang repo with this template built by members of the Go community\\n- **React SSR Template** \u2014 create a website powered with Next.js\\n- **Spring Boot GRPC** \u2014 create a simple microservice using gRPC and Spring Boot Java\\n\\n### The getting started guide gets automated\\n\\nSince the templates can be customized to integrate with your existing infrastructure, it\u2019s easy to start a new project without ever having to leave Backstage. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re building a microservice. With three clicks in Backstage, you\u2019ll have a new Spring Boot project with your repo automatically configured on GitHub and your CI already running the first build.\\n\\n### Golden Paths pave the way\\n\\nYou can customize Backstage Software Templates to fit your organization\u2019s standards. Using Go instead of Java? CircleCI instead of Jenkins? Serverless instead of Kubernetes? GCP instead of AWS? [Make your own recipes for any software component](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/adding-templates) and your best practices will be baked right in.\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\nThe sample Software Templates are available under `/create`. If you\'re setting up Backstage for the first time, follow [Getting Started with Backstage](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/) and go to `http://localhost:3000/create`.\\n\\n![available-templates](assets/2020-08-05/templates.png)\\n\\n### Step 1: Choose a template\\n\\nWhen you select a template that you want to create, you can ask for different input variables. These are then passed to the templater internally.\\n\\n![template-form](assets/2020-08-05/template-form.png)\\n\\nAfter filling in these variables, additional fields will appear so Backstage can be used. You\u2019ll specify the owner, which is a `user` in the Backstage system, and the `Location`, which must be a GitHub organization and a non-existing GitHub repository name, formatted as `organization/reponame`.\\n\\n### Step 2: Run!\\n\\nOnce you\'ve entered values and confirmed, you\'ll then get a modal with live progress of what is currently happening with the creation of your template.\\n\\n![create-component](assets/2020-08-05/create-component.png)\\n\\nIt shouldn\'t take too long before you see a success screen. At this point, a piece of \u201CHello World\u201D software has been created in your repo, and the CI automatically picks it up and starts building the code.\\n\\nYour engineers don\u2019t have to bother with setting up underlying infrastructure, it\u2019s all built into the template. They can start focusing on delivering business value.\\n\\n### View new components in the Service Catalog\\n\\nNew components, of course, get added automatically to the Backstage Service Catalog. After creation, you\'ll see the `View in Catalog` button, which will take you to the registered component in the catalog:\\n\\n![service-catalog](assets/2020-08-05/catalog.png)\\n\\n## Define your standards\\n\\nBackstage ships with four example templates, but since these are likely not the (only) ones you want to promote inside your company, the next step is to add [your own templates](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/). Using Backstage\u2019s Software Templates feature, it\u2019s easy to help your engineers get started building software with your organization\u2019s best practices built-in.\\n\\nWe have learned that one of the keys to getting these standards adopted is to keep an open process. Templates are code. By making it clear to your engineers that you are open to pull requests, and that teams with different needs can add their own templates, you are on the path of striking a good balance between autonomy and standardization.\\n\\nIf you have feedback or questions, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues), ping us on [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673) or send us an email at [backstage-interest@spotify.com](mailto:backstage-interest@spotify.com) \u{1F64F}\\n\\nTo get regular product updates and news about the Backstage community, sign up for the [Backstage newsletter](https://spoti.fi/backstagenewsletter)."},{"id":"/2020/07/01/how-to-enable-authentication-in-backstage-using-passport","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/07/01/how-to-enable-authentication-in-backstage-using-passport","source":"@site/blog/2020-07-01-how-to-enable-authentication-in-backstage-using-passport.mdx","title":"How to enable authentication in Backstage using Passport","description":"auth-landing-page","date":"2020-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":2.44,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Lee Mills, Spotify","url":"https://github.com/leemills83","imageURL":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1236238?s=460&v=4","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How to enable authentication in Backstage using Passport","author":"Lee Mills, Spotify","authorURL":"https://github.com/leemills83","authorImageURL":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1236238?s=460&v=4"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Announcing Backstage Software Templates","permalink":"/blog/2020/08/05/announcing-backstage-software-templates"},"nextItem":{"title":"Backstage Service Catalog released in alpha","permalink":"/blog/2020/06/22/backstage-service-catalog-alpha"}},"content":"![auth-landing-page](assets/20-07-01/auth-landing.png)\\n\\nGetting authentication right is important. It helps keep your platform safe, it\u2019s one of the first things users will interact with, and there are many different authentication providers to support. To this end, we chose to use [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) to provide an easy-to-use, out-of-the-box experience that can be extended to your own, pre-existing authentication providers (known as strategies). The Auth APIs in Backstage serve two purposes: identify the user and provide a way for plugins to request access to third-party services on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve already implemented Google and GitHub authentication to provide examples and to get you started.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## What is Passport?\\n\\n[Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) is Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js that provides access to over 500 authentication providers, covering everything from Google, Facebook, and Twitter to generic OAuth, SAML, and local. Check out all of the currently available [strategies listed on the Passport site](http://www.passportjs.org/).\\n\\nPassport has allowed us to leverage an existing open-source authentication framework that will, in turn, give users the freedom to add and extend alternative authentication strategies to their instance of Backstage.\\n\\n## Using authentication in Backstage\\n\\n![auth-landing-page](assets/20-07-01/auth-sidebar.png)\\n\\nFirst, check out the provided Google and GitHub implementations! [Spin up a local copy of Backstage](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/04/30/how-to-quickly-set-up-backstage) along with our example-backend. You can find more documentation on setting up the example backend [here](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/packages/backend), but be sure to include the relevant client IDs and secrets when running `yarn start`:\\n\\n```\\nAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=x AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=x AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=x AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=x SENTRY_TOKEN=x LOG_LEVEL=debug yarn start\\n```\\n\\nYou can find the implementation for these strategies along with a lightweight proof-of-concept implementation for SAML authentication at `<root>/plugins/auth-backend/src/providers`.\\n\\n## Ready to get started by adding your chosen provider and implementation?\\n\\nGetting started is really straightforward, and can be broadly broken down into five steps:\\n\\n1. Install the [Passport-based provider package that best suits your needs](http://www.passportjs.org/).\\n2. Add a new provider to `plugins/auth-backend/src/providers/`\\n3. Implement the provider, extending the suitable framework, if needed.\\n4. Add the provider to the backend.\\n5. Add a frontend Auth Utility API.\\n\\nFor full details, take a look at our [\u201CAdding authentication providers\u201D documentation](/docs/auth/add-auth-provider) and at the [excellent documentation](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/) provided by Passport.\\n\\n## Interested in contributing to the next steps for authentication?\\n\\nWe\u2019ve already seen both GitLab and Okta contributions from the community \u2014 and we\u2019re thinking about a few more providers we\u2019d like to add to Backstage, too. You can find those, and other authentication-related issues, in our repository by filtering with the [auth label](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aauth)."},{"id":"/2020/06/22/backstage-service-catalog-alpha","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/06/22/backstage-service-catalog-alpha","source":"@site/blog/2020-06-22-backstage-service-catalog-alpha.mdx","title":"Backstage Service Catalog released in alpha","description":"TL;DR Today we are announcing the availability of the Backstage Service Catalog in alpha.

One of the main reasons we pushed to release it, despite it being in such a nascent stage, was so that we could start building the next phase of Backstage around the community\u2019s needs. We\u2019ve had hours of conversations with so many of you \u2014 thank you to everyone who has jumped on a video call, attended one of our working sessions, or watched our [demo videos](https://backstage.io/demos) and provided feedback via [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/MUpMjP2).\\n\\nToday, we wanted to share what we\u2019ve learned from talking with many of you at companies that have shown interest in adopting Backstage. Here it is in short:\\n\\n- The problem of scaling autonomous engineering organisations without creating too much complexity is not a unique problem to Spotify.\\n- The \\"extensible frontend platform\\" that we focused on in the first phase of the project is not the only thing you are looking for.\\n\\nWith these insights we decided to re-focus our efforts towards the most requested feature: the Backstage Service Catalog.\\n\\n## What is the service catalog?\\n\\nThe Backstage Service Catalog \u2014 actually, a software catalog, since it includes more than just services \u2014 is a centralized system that keeps track of ownership and metadata for all the software in your ecosystem (services, websites, libraries, data pipelines, etc). The catalog is built around the concept of [metadata yaml files](/docs/architecture-decisions/adrs-adr002) stored together with the code, which are then harvested and visualized in Backstage.\\n\\nThis was our pitch for the virtues of a service catalog when we first [announced](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/05/22/phase-2-service-catalog) it as part of Phase 2:\\n\\n> With a single catalog, Backstage makes it easy for a team to manage ten services \u2014 and makes it possible for your company to manage thousands of them. Because the system is practically self-organizing, it requires hardly any oversight from a governing or centralized team. Developers can get a uniform overview of all their software and related resources (such as server utilisation, data pipelines, pull request status), regardless of how and where they are running, as well as an easy way to onboard and manage those resources.\\n\\n> On top of that, we have found that the service catalog is a great way to organise the infrastructure tools you use to manage the software as well. This is how Backstage creates one developer portal for all your tools. Rather than asking teams to jump between different infrastructure UI\u2019s (and incurring additional cognitive overhead each time they make a context switch), most of these tools can be organised around the entities in the catalog:\\n\\n![img](assets/20-05-20/tabs.png)\\n\\nYou\u2019ll be able to see many of these virtues in action with this alpha release \u2014 though, with some caveats, of course, since it is, after all, an alpha.\\n\\n## What does alpha mean?\\n\\nAlpha is our shorthand for \\"we don\u2019t yet think Backstage is ready for production, but we\u2019d love for you to test it and provide us with feedback\\". However, you should be able to try out the functionality of the service catalog:\\n\\n1. Register software components ([examples](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/packages/catalog-model/examples))\\n2. See all components represented in the catalog\\n3. Search across all components\\n4. Get an overview of the metadata of the components\\n5. Click through and get more information about a specific component (service, website, etc)\\n6. See example tooling (plugins) that helps you manage the component\\n\\nAs with most alpha releases, you should expect things to change quite a lot until we reach the beta stage (we\u2019re targeting the end of summer). There are obviously many things missing as well, but we wanted to start collecting feedback early and make it easier to see the end-to-end flow.\\n\\nIf you have feedback or questions, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues), ping us on [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673) or send us an email at [backstage-interest@spotify.com](mailto:backstage-interest@spotify.com) \u{1F64F}\\n\\nTo get regular product updates and news about the Backstage community, sign up for the [Backstage newsletter](https://spoti.fi/backstagenewsletter)."},{"id":"/2020/05/22/phase-2-service-catalog","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/05/22/phase-2-service-catalog","source":"@site/blog/2020-05-22-phase-2-service-catalog.mdx","title":"Starting Phase 2: The Service Catalog","description":"TL;DR Thanks to the help from the Backstage community, we\u2019ve made excellent progress and are now moving into Phase 2 of Backstage \u2014 building out a Service Catalog and the surrounding systems that will help unify the tools you use to manage your software.","date":"2020-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":4.14,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan \xc5lund, Spotify","url":"http://twitter.com/stalund","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/121166861/6919c047c0d0edaace78c3009b28e917-user-full-200-130.generated_400x400.jpg","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Starting Phase 2: The Service Catalog","author":"Stefan \xc5lund, Spotify","authorURL":"http://twitter.com/stalund","authorImageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/121166861/6919c047c0d0edaace78c3009b28e917-user-full-200-130.generated_400x400.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Backstage Service Catalog released in alpha","permalink":"/blog/2020/06/22/backstage-service-catalog-alpha"},"nextItem":{"title":"Introducing Tech Radar for Backstage","permalink":"/blog/2020/05/14/tech-radar-plugin"}},"content":"**TL;DR** Thanks to the help from the Backstage community, we\u2019ve made excellent progress and are now moving into Phase 2 of Backstage \u2014 building out a Service Catalog and the surrounding systems that will help unify the tools you use to manage your software.\\n\\nWe released the open source version of Backstage a little less than two months ago, and have been thrilled to see so many people jumping in and contributing to the project in its early stages. We\u2019re excited to see what the community can build together as we progress through [each phase of Backstage](https://github.com/backstage/backstage#project-roadmap).\\n\\n![img](assets/20-05-20/Service_Catalog_MVP.png)\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Progress so far\\n\\nPhase 1 was all about building an extensible frontend platform, enabling teams to start creating a single, consistent UI layer for your internal infrastructure and tools in the form of [plugins](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/labels/plugin). In fact, thanks to our amazing (30+) [contributors](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/graphs/contributors), we were able to complete most of Phase 1 earlier than expected. \u{1F389}\\n\\nToday, we are happy to announce that we are shifting our focus to Phase 2!\\n\\n## So what is Phase 2?\\n\\n> _The core of building Platforms rests in versatile entity management. Entities represent the nouns or the \\"truths\\" of our world._\\n\\nQuote from [Platform Nuts & Bolts: Extendable Data Models](https://www.kislayverma.com/post/platform-nuts-bolts-extendable-data-models)\\n\\nEntities, or what we refer to as \u201Ccomponents\u201D in Backstage, represent all software, including services, websites, libraries, data pipelines, and so forth. The focus of Phase 2 will be on adding an entity model in Backstage that makes it easy for engineers to create and manage the software components they own.\\n\\nWith the ability to create a plethora of components in Backstage, how does one keep track of all the software in the ecosystem? Therein lies the highlight feature of Phase 2: the [Service Catalog](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/4). The service catalog \u2014 or software catalog \u2014 is a centralized system that keeps track of ownership and metadata about all software in your ecosystem. The catalog is built around the concept of [metadata yaml files](/docs/architecture-decisions/adrs-adr002) stored together with the code, which are then harvested and visualized in Backstage.\\n\\n![img](assets/20-05-20/Service_Catalog_MVP.png)\\n\\n![img](assets/20-05-20/Service_Catalog_MVP_service.png)\\n\\nWith a single catalog, Backstage makes it easy for a team to manage ten services \u2014 and makes it possible for your company to manage thousands of them. Because the system is practically self-organizing, it requires hardly any oversight from a governing or centralized team. Developers can get a uniform overview of all their software and related resources (such as server utilisation, data pipelines, pull request status), regardless of how and where they are running, as well as an easy way to onboard and manage those resources.\\n\\nOn top of that, we have found that the service catalog is a great way to organise the infrastructure tools you use to manage the software as well. This is how Backstage creates one developer portal for all your tools.

You get the point.\\n\\n## Timeline\\n\\nOur estimated timeline has us delivering these pieces in increments leading up to June 22.

Today, we\u2019re excited to add a new plugin to that list \u2014 say hello to the [Tech Radar plugin]!\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## What is Tech Radar?\\n\\nThe Technology Radar is a concept created by [ThoughtWorks] which allows you to visualize the official guidelines of software languages, processes, infrastructure, and platforms at that particular company. The particular visualization above was created by [Zalando].\\n\\nAt Spotify, our central committee of technical architects own the Tech Radar with the input of engineers across the company. Anyone can and is encouraged to give recommendations. We segment entries in our Tech Radar by languages, frameworks, processes, and infrastructure, although you should pick whatever works best for your organization. Each entry in the Tech Radar can have one of the following lifecycle values: Use, Trial, Assess, and Hold.\\n\\nWe also assign clear definitions for each lifecycle:\\n\\n- **Use:** This technology is recommended for use by the majority of teams with a specific use case.\\n- **Trial:** This technology has been evaluated for specific use cases and has showed clear benefits. Some teams adopt it in production, although it should be limited to low-impact projects as it might incur a higher risk.\\n- **Assess:** This technology has the potential to be beneficial for the company. Some teams are evaluating it and using it in experimental projects. Using it in production comes with a high cost and risk due to lack of in-house knowledge, maintenance, and support.\\n- **Hold:** We don\'t want to further invest in this technology or we evaluated it and we don\'t see it as beneficial for the company. Teams should not use it in new projects and should plan on migrating to a supported alternative if they use it for historical reasons. For broadly adopted technologies, the Radar should refer to a migration path to a supported alternative.\\n\\nSince rolling out the Tech Radar, it has become the source of truth when creating, maintaining, or evolving our software ecosystem. Spotify has dozens of entries in our Radar and it can scale quite well whilst being easy for our engineers and engineering managers to consume.\\n\\n## Using the Tech Radar in Backstage\\n\\nTo learn about how you can bring the Tech Radar to your Backstage installation, check out [the plugin README on GitHub][tech radar plugin].\\n\\n## A personal note\\n\\nI want to thank both the Backstage team and Spotify. Firstly, I\'ve been working with our internal version of Backstage for over a year, and the developer experience since open sourcing has been even more of a joy to work with. Secondly, the 10% hack time that Spotify generously provides to all engineers enabled me to open source the Tech Radar plugin.\\n\\nSince open sourcing it, the community has shown great interest in yet another powerful use case of Backstage. There was also an enthusiastic open source contributor who volunteered to migrate the plugin to TypeScript and React Hooks [in just 29 minutes](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/661) of opening the issue!\\n\\nI can\'t wait to see how others benefit from the Tech Radar in their organizations!\\n\\n[lighthouse website audits]: https://backstage.io/blog/2020/04/06/lighthouse-plugin\\n[tech radar plugin]: https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/tech-radar/plugins/tech-radar\\n[thoughtworks]: https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar\\n[zalando]: https://opensource.zalando.com/tech-radar/"},{"id":"/2020/05/14/weaveworks-covid-19-app-uses-backstage-ui","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/05/14/weaveworks-covid-19-app-uses-backstage-ui","source":"@site/blog/2020-05-14-weaveworks-covid-19-app-uses-backstage-ui.mdx","title":"Weaveworks\u2019 COVID-19 app uses Backstage UI","description":"fk-covid-screenshot","date":"2020-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":2.13,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jeff Feng, Spotify","url":"https://github.com/fengypants","imageURL":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/46946747","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weaveworks\u2019 COVID-19 app uses Backstage UI","author":"Jeff Feng, Spotify","authorURL":"https://github.com/fengypants","authorImageURL":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/46946747"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Introducing Tech Radar for Backstage","permalink":"/blog/2020/05/14/tech-radar-plugin"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to quickly set up Backstage","permalink":"/blog/2020/04/30/how-to-quickly-set-up-backstage"}},"content":"![fk-covid-screenshot](assets/20-05-14/weaveworks-firekube-covid-19-spotify-backstage.png)\\n\\nOne of the great things about the open source community is once you put your work out there, you really never know where it might end up. That\u2019s certainly the case here.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nWhen Weaveworks decided to build an X-ray diagnostics app to help fight COVID-19, they pulled together a lot of different open source resources \u2014 from projects big and small, built by both familiar tech partners and some brand new ones, too.\\n\\nAt the heart of their app \u2014 called [fk-covid][] \u2014 there\u2019s a TensorFlow-based deep neural network that was developed by researchers on the DarwinAI team and others in the COVID R&D community. To package that network up for doctors and software developers to use, the app combines open source tools from Google, AWS, Azure, MinIO, the CNCF, and Weaveworks\u2019 own Firekube bundle for Kubernetes.\\n\\nAnd the user interface for all of this? Weaveworks built a custom plugin using the Backstage framework.\\n\\n\u201CWe chose Backstage as a modern UI toolkit that we knew would work with Kubernetes apps,\u201D said Alexis Richardson, CEO of Weaveworks. \u201CWe were also experimenting with Backstage for microservices and ML, so it was natural to try it here.\u201D\\n\\nChanwit Kaewkasi, Weaveworks\u2019 DX Engineer and a tech lead on the project, said, \u201CBackstage offers very advanced plugin architecture which allows us to only focus on the plugin we\'re developing. Other things are taken care of by the framework.\u201D\\n\\nIn other words, here\u2019s Backstage doing what Backstage does best: unifying a bunch of technologies with a cohesive frontend, so that the whole thing is easier to build and easier to use.\\n\\nJoining the fight against a global pandemic was not something the Backstage team at Spotify ever envisioned when we released our homegrown developer portal to the world back in March. But it\u2019s a testament to the ingenuity (and serendipity) of the open source community that Backstage could be enlisted for such an unexpected use case.\\n\\nWe\u2019re proud to see Backstage adopted as the UX layer for this meaningful cause. And we can\u2019t wait to see what the open source community will build next.\\n\\nTo learn more about what fk-covid does, and how it works, jump on over to [the Weaveworks blog][] to hear it straight from the team that built it. It\u2019s a great example of the possibilities that come from being a part of the open source community.\\n\\n[fk-covid]: https://github.com/weaveworks/fk-covid\\n[the weaveworks blog]: https://www.weave.works/blog/firekube-covid-ml"},{"id":"/2020/04/30/how-to-quickly-set-up-backstage","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/04/30/how-to-quickly-set-up-backstage","source":"@site/blog/2020-04-30-how-to-quickly-set-up-backstage.mdx","title":"How to quickly set up Backstage","description":"We wanted to make getting started with Backstage as easy as possible.

Even though Backstage is still in the early phases of its development, we believe it is important for our users to get a feel for what Backstage really is.\\n\\nWe want users to be able to create their own version of Backstage quickly and easily, so that they can take advantage of all the infrastructure that we\u2019ve built into it \u2014 and start exploring.\\n\\nIn this blog post we\u2019ll look at what a Backstage app is and how to create one using our [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/cli).\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## What is a Backstage app?\\n\\n![](assets/4/welcome.png)\\n\\nA Backstage app is a modern monorepo web project that is built using Backstage packages. It includes all the configuration and architecture you need to run Backstage so that you don\u2019t have to worry about setting everything up by yourself.\\n\\nMore specifically, a Backstage app includes the core packages and APIs that provide base functionality to the app. The actual UX is provided by plugins. As an example, when you first load the `/` page of the app, the content is provided by the `welcome` plugin.\\n\\nPlugins are the essential building blocks of Backstage and extend the platform by providing additional features and functionality. Read more about [Backstage plugins](/docs/getting-started) on GitHub.\\n\\n## A personalized platform\\n\\nWhen you create a Backstage _app_, you are creating your own installation of Backstage, an application that is built on top of the Backstage _platform_.\\n\\nYou get to take full advantage of a platform that we at Spotify have been using internally for years. But you also get to make it your own \u2014 starting with its name. You can rename the Backstage app anything you want, so that you can call it something that best fits your organization. Be creative!\\n\\n## How do I create an app?\\n\\nJust run the backstage-cli:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx @backstage/create-app\\n```\\n\\nName your app, and we will create everything you need:\\n\\n![](assets/4/create-app.png)\\n\\nThe only thing you need to do is to start the app:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd my-app\\nyarn start\\n```\\n\\nAnd you are good to go! \u{1F44D}\\n\\nRead the full documentation on how to [create an app](/docs/getting-started/create-an-app) on GitHub.\\n\\n## What do I get? (Let\'s get technical...)\\n\\nWe\u2019ve been using Backstage internally for years, and we\u2019ve spent a lot of time adding to and tweaking the infrastructure so that it fits our needs. After all that testing and trial and error, we think it will fit your needs, too!\\n\\n### 1. Lerna setup to manage multi-packages\\n\\nThe monorepo and its packages are managed by [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/). It lets you work with individual packages in a controlled way.\\n\\n### 2. Fast builds\\n\\nBehind the scenes we use [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to build the modules.\\n\\nEach package is built individually. With the `--watch` flag you will be able to detect changes per package and therefore speed up the local development process.\\n\\nTo further speed things up, we have also included our own caching system to avoid rebuilding unchanged packages.\\n\\nOur hope is that there will be thousands of Backstage plugins in the future, so we need a fast and stable build process.\\n\\n### 3. Full TypeScript support\\n\\nMost of the codebase is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and we aim for all of the core packages to be in TypeScript in the future.\\n\\nAll the knobs and handles needed for a stable and functioning TypeScript project are included.\\n\\nTake a look at `@backstage/cli/config/tsconfig.json` for more details.\\n\\n### 4. Tests and coverage out of the box\\n\\nWe include testing, linting, and end-to-end tests for your convenience.\\n\\n```bash\\nyarn lint:all\\nyarn test:all\\nyarn test:e2e\\n```\\n\\n## Extend the app with plugins\\n\\nAt Spotify, the main factor behind Backstage\u2019s success has been our large and diverse collection of plugins \u2014 the result of contributions from various teams over the years. Internally, we have more than a hundred different plugins.\\n\\nThere are two ways to add plugins to your Backstage app: use a publicly available plugin or create your own.\\n\\n### Using a public plugin\\n\\nWe provide a collection of public Backstage plugins (look for packages with the `plugin-` prefix under the `@backstage` namespace on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) that you can start using immediately.\\n\\nInstall in your app\u2019s package folder (`<root>/packages/app`) with:\\n\\n```bash\\n# From your Backstage root directory\\nyarn --cwd packages/app add @backstage/plugin-<plugin-name>\\n```\\n\\nAfter that, you inject the plugin into the application where you want it to be exposed. Please read the documentation for the specific plugin you are installing for more information.\\n\\n### Creating an internal plugin\\n\\nWe also know that each organization has different needs and will create their own plugins for internal purposes. To create an internal plugin, you can use our CLI again.\\n\\nIn the root of your app directory (`<root>`) run:\\n\\n```bash\\nyarn create-plugin\\n```\\n\\nThis command will create a new plugin in `<root>/plugins/` and register it to your app automatically.\\n\\n### Sharing is caring \u{1F917}\\n\\nIf you are developing a plugin that might be useful for others, consider releasing it publicly. A large, diverse ecosystem of Backstage plugins benefits the whole community\\n\\n## Ready to get started?\\n\\nHead over to GitHub and check out the [project](https://github.com/backstage/backstage) or download our [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/cli).

This plugin works with the newly open-sourced [lighthouse-audit-service](https://github.com/spotify/lighthouse-audit-service) to run and track Lighthouse audits for your websites.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## What is Lighthouse?\\n\\nGoogle\'s [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) auditing tool for websites is a great open-source resource for benchmarking and improving the accessibility, performance, SEO, and best practices of your site.\\n\\nAt Spotify, we keep track of Lighthouse audit scores over time to look at trends and areas for investment. We particularly look to Lighthouse to give us [accessibility recommendations](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/v3/scoring#a11y); in the next few months, we plan to roll out Lighthouse accessibility category scores as a benchmark metric for all websites at Spotify.\\n\\n## Lighthouse, tracked over time\\n\\nWhat makes the plugin unique is that we can track a website\'s audit performance over time using the main metrics that Lighthouse outputs, rather than simply running reports. The sparklines show, at a glance, how all of your websites are holding up over recent builds.\\n\\n![image of the audit list in the Lighthouse plugin](assets/3/audit-list.png)\\n\\nLighthouse reports can be viewed directly in Backstage, with the ability to travel back and forth through your audit history, so you can quickly diagnose which release caused a performance or SEO regression.\\n\\n![image of the audit view in the Lighthouse plugin](assets/3/audit-view.png)\\n\\nTrigger an audit directly from Backstage, or trigger audits programmatically with your new lighthouse-audit-service instance. Schedule them after builds as a sort of smoke test, or trigger them on a schedule (as we do at Spotify) to get a daily snapshot of your website.\\n\\n![image of the create audit form in the Lighthouse plugin](assets/3/create-audit.png)\\n\\n## Using Lighthouse in Backstage\\n\\nTo learn how you can enable Lighthouse auditing within Backstage, head over to the [README](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/lighthouse/plugins/lighthouse) for the plugin to get started.\\n\\n## A personal note\\n\\nI want to thank the folks on the Backstage team for approaching me to open-source this plugin. I have found working on Backstage to be a really rewarding and fun time, and I\'m so glad that the core team members have put in the effort to make Backstage something that anyone in the industry can use. I can\'t wait to play with all the plugins the community is going to create.

And we learned a thing or two via the feedback we received. So, I wanted to take this opportunity to further explain what we\u2019re trying to do with Backstage \u2014 and more importantly, what we want to give to the greater engineering community beyond Spotify.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## What\u2019s the big infrastructure problem?\\n\\nAs companies grow, their infrastructure systems get messier. Consider a team that wants to deploy something to the cloud. While Spotify has many awesome engineers, not every engineer is well-versed in our chosen cloud-provider tooling. Yet everyone is required to know and understand Terraform, GCP/AWS/Azure CLIs, GitLab CI, Prometheus, Kubernetes, Docker, various monitoring and alerting tools, and much, much more. Once other resources come into play (databases, queueing, etc.), each engineer requires even more tools and domain-specific knowledge (or \u201Cdisciplines\u201D), from backend to machine learning, to mobile and data.\\n\\n## What\u2019s the fix?\\n\\nBackstage unifies all your infrastructure tooling, services, and documentation with a single, consistent UI. All of it! Imagine if all your tools \u2014 GCP, Bigtable, CI pipelines, TensorFlow Extended, and whatever else is hiding in your stack \u2014 all had the same, easy-to-use interface. That\u2019s Backstage. One front end for all your infrastructure.\\n\\n![img](assets/2/screen.gif)\\n\\nBackstage gives developers a uniform overview of all their resources, regardless of how and where they are running, as well as an easy way to onboard and start using those tools. It also allows the creation of new resources, such as backend services running in Kubernetes, with a few clicks of a button \u2014 all without having to leave the same, familiar interface of Backstage.\\n\\n## Why did we build it?\\n\\nTo some observers, it may seem odd that a music company is launching a best-in-class developer portal. But if you [dig deeper](https://backstage.io/background), you\u2019ll find that since the very beginning, Spotify has been known for its agile, autonomous engineering culture. More than music, we\u2019re a tech company that has always put engineers first, empowering our developers with the ability to innovate quickly and at scale. Backstage is the natural result of that focus.\\n\\n## What are examples of how Backstage is used at Spotify?\\n\\nOur internal installation of Backstage has over 100 different integrations \u2014 we call them \u201Cplugins\u201D. Since the open-source version currently does not have any end-to-end use cases, it can be challenging to understand what problems Backstage can solve for you. To make things more tangible, let\u2019s have a look at four of the common use-cases:\\n\\n1. Creating a new microservice\\n2. Following a pull request from review to production\\n3. Centralised technical documentation\\n4. Review performance of your team\u2019s mobile features\\n\\nThese are just a few examples. Expect us to continue providing examples of how Backstage is used inside Spotify while we build out more end-2-end use-cases in the open.\\n\\n### 1. Creating a new microservice\\n\\nCreating any new software component at Spotify, such as a new microservice, is done with a few clicks in Backstage. Developers choose between a number of standard templates \u2014 all with best-practices built in.\\n\\n![img](assets/2/1.png)\\n\\nAfter inputting some metadata about your service, a new repository is created with a \u201Chello world\u201D service that automatically builds and deploys in production on Kubernetes ([GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)). Ownership information is automatically captured in our service/software catalog and users can see a list of all the services they own.\\n\\n![img](assets/2/2.png)\\n\\n### 2. Following a pull request from review to production\\n\\nAs soon as you submit a pull request to Spotify\u2019s GitHub Enterprise, our CI system automatically posts a link to the CI/CD view in Backstage. The view provides you with all the information you need: build progress, test coverage changes, a re-trigger button, etc., so that you don\u2019t have to look for this information across different systems.\\n\\n![img](assets/2/3.png)\\n\\nOur homegrown CI system uses Jenkins under the hood, but Spotify engineers don\u2019t need to know that. They interact directly with GitHub Enterprise and Backstage.\\n\\n### 3. Centralised technical documentation\\n\\nSpotify uses a [docs-like-code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFGCaZmA6d4) approach. Engineers write technical documentation in Markdown files that live together with the code. During CI, a beautiful-looking documentation site is created using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), and all sites are rendered centrally in a Backstage plugin.\\n\\n![img](assets/2/4.png)\\n\\nOn top of the static documentation we also incorporate additional metadata about the documentation site \u2014 such as owner, open issue and related Stack Overflow tags.\\n\\n### 4. Review performance of your team\u2019s mobile features\\n\\nOur mobile apps are developed by many different teams. The codebase is divided up into different features, each owned and maintained by a separate team. If an app developer on one team wants to understand how their feature is affecting overall app performance, there\u2019s a plugin for that:\\n\\n![img](assets/2/5.png)\\n_Figures above for illustrative purposes only._\\n\\nDevelopers can also look at crashes, releases, test coverage over time and many more tools in the same location.\\n\\n## Why did we make Backstage open source?\\n\\nWhen discussing infrastructure challenges with peer companies, it\u2019s clear that we are not alone in struggling with fragmentation across our developer ecosystem. As companies adopt more open-source tooling, and build more infrastructure internally, the complexity grows. It gets harder for individual engineers to find and use all these distinct tools.\\n\\nSimilar to how Backstage ties together all of Spotify\u2019s infrastructure, our ambition is to make the open-source version of Backstage the standard UX layer across the broader infrastructure landscape. We decided to release Backstage early so we could collaborate more closely with companies that have a similar problem \u2014 and that want to provide a better developer experience to their teams.\\n\\n## What\u2019s next?\\n\\nWe are envisioning [three phases](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestones) of the project (so far), and we have already begun work on various aspects of these phases. The best way to track the work and see where you can jump in and help out is:\\n\\nhttps://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestones\\n\\nWant to discuss the project or need support?

With an elegant and unified, yet opinionated UI/UX for all your tooling and infrastructure, Backstage enables engineers to get up and running faster, which ultimately makes their lives easier and more productive.\\n\\n![img](assets/blog_1.png)\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## As simple as writing a plugin.\\n\\nBackstage makes it easy to unify all of your infrastructure tooling, services, and documentation under a single, easy-to-use interface. So your engineers will always know where to find the right tool for the job. And engineers will already know how to use each tool \u2014 because everything uses the same, familiar UI.\\n\\nThe number of open source infrastructure projects and tools [landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/) is exploding. As the sheer volume of projects increases, companies and their engineers find it increasingly difficult to keep track and adopt all of the tooling fast enough to keep pace. Most of the tools were built by a different individual, team, or company, which means that there is no single UI/UX, and simply getting the tool installed and started can be a painful challenge- let alone wrangling each tool to work with one another within your existing ecosystem. Due to varying qualities and the varying UI/UX of each open source project, we\'d like to introduce Backstage as a best-of-breed platform for developers to use... all in service of ensuring a flawless, consistent user experience.\\n\\n![illustration](assets/illustration.svg)\\n\\n## The Spotify story\\n\\nA best-in-class developer portal \u2014 from a music company? Since the very beginning, Spotify has been known for its agile, autonomous engineering culture. More than music, we\u2019re a tech company that has always put engineers first, empowering our developers with the ability to innovate quickly and at scale. Backstage is the natural result of that focus.\\n\\nSince adopting Backstage internally at Spotify, we\u2019ve seen a 55% decrease in onboarding time for our engineers (as measured by time until 10th pull request). Over 280 engineering teams inside Spotify are using Backstage to manage 2,000+ backend services, 300+ websites, 4,000+ data pipelines, and 200+ mobile features.\\n\\n## Project roadmap\\n\\nWe created Backstage about 4 years ago, and today, we\u2019ve decided to share the goodness with the greater engineering community. While our version of Backstage has had the benefit of time to mature and evolve, the first iteration of our open source version is still nascent. I wanted to take a moment to share with you what our vision for Backstage OSS is so that 1. users and our community gain a better understanding of where we\u2019re envisioning the product to go and more importantly, 2. you can provide input and feedback so that together, we can create a better infrastructure experience for developers everywhere.\\n\\nWe are envisioning three phases of the project and we have already begun work on various aspects of these phases:\\n\\n- **Phase 1:** Extensible frontend platform (now) - You will be able to easily create a single consistent UI layer for your internal infrastructure and tools. A set of reusable UX patterns and components help ensure a consistent experience between tools.\\n\\n- **Phase 2:** Manage your stuff (next 2-3 months) - Manage anything from microservices to software components to infrastructure and your service catalog. Regardless of whether you want to create a new library, view service deployment status in Kubernetes, or check the test coverage for a website -- Backstage will provide all of those tools - and many more - in a single developer portal.\\n\\n- **Phase 3:** Ecosystem (later) - Everyone\'s infrastructure stack is different. By fostering a vibrant community of contributors we hope to provide an ecosystem of Open Source plugins/integrations that allows you to pick the tools that match your stack.\\n\\nOur vision for Backstage is for it to become the trusted standard toolbox (read: UI layer) for the open source infrastructure landscape. Think of it like Kubernetes for developer experience. We realize this is an ambitious goal. We can\u2019t do it alone. If this sounds interesting or you\'d like to help us shape our product vision, we\'d love to talk.
