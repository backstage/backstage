## Version 0.1.0

We're excited to share the initial release of Canon ðŸ’š In this first alpha version,
you'll find the foundation of our design system: a set of versatile layout components
and a handful of essential atomic elements to help you get started. While Canon is
still in its early stages, it's ready for exploration and we'd love for you to give
it a try and share your feedback.
