## Examples

### All variants

The `Text` component has a `variant` prop that can be used to change the
appearance of the text.

<Snippet
  open
  preview={<TextAllVariants />}
  code={`<Stack gap="md">
    <Text variant="subtitle" style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}>
      A man looks at a painting in a museum and says, “Brothers and sisters I
      have none, but that man&apos;s father is my father&apos;s son.” Who is
      in the painting?
    </Text>
    <Text variant="body" style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}>
      A man looks at a painting in a museum and says, “Brothers and sisters I
      have none, but that man&apos;s father is my father&apos;s son.” Who is
      in the painting?
    </Text>
    <Text variant="caption" style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}>
      A man looks at a painting in a museum and says, “Brothers and sisters I
      have none, but that man&apos;s father is my father&apos;s son.” Who is
      in the painting?
    </Text>
    <Text variant="label" style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}>
      A man looks at a painting in a museum and says, “Brothers and sisters I
      have none, but that man&apos;s father is my father&apos;s son.” Who is
      in the painting?
    </Text>
  </Stack>`}
/>

### All weights

The `Text` component has a `weight` prop that can be used to change the
appearance of the text.

<Snippet
  open
  preview={<TextAllWeights />}
  code={`<Stack gap="md">
    <Text weight="regular" style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}>
      A man looks at a painting in a museum and says, “Brothers and sisters I
      have none, but that man&apos;s father is my father&apos;s son.” Who is
      in the painting?
    </Text>
    <Text weight="bold" style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}>
      A man looks at a painting in a museum and says, “Brothers and sisters I
      have none, but that man&apos;s father is my father&apos;s son.” Who is
      in the painting?
    </Text>
  </Stack>`}
/>

### Responsive

You can also use the `variant` prop to change the appearance of the text based
on the screen size.

<Snippet
  open
  preview={<TextResponsive />}
  code={`<Text variant={{ initial: 'body', lg: 'subtitle' }}>
    Responsive text
  </Text>`}
/>
