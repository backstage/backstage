# Typography

Canon offers a suite of typography components designed to seamlessly align
with the rest of your Backstage instance. While you can customize their
appearance to match your brand, the underlying API remains consistent and
unchanged. Each component is built on a responsive structure, allowing you to
define different typography values for various breakpoints.

## Headings

Headings are used to structure the content of your page. They are used to
create a hierarchy of information and to make the content more readable. The
best way to use add these headings to your page is to import the [Heading
component](?path=/docs/components-heading--docs).

<Snippet
  py={2}
  open
  preview={<HeadingAllVariants />}
  code={`<Stack gap="md">
    <Heading variant="display">Display</Heading>
    <Heading variant="title1">Title 1</Heading>
    <Heading variant="title2">Title 2</Heading>
    <Heading variant="title3">Title 3</Heading>
    <Heading variant="title4">Title 4</Heading>
</Stack>`}
/>

## Text

Canon provides four distinct text variants, each offering different font sizes
carefully designed to cover the majority of use cases. These variants are
versatile and can be paired with regular and bold of font weights. You can use
the [Text component](?path=/docs/components-text--docs) to add text to your
page.

<Snippet
  open
  preview={<TextAllVariants />}
  code={`<Stack gap="md">
    <Text variant="subtitle" style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}>
      A man looks at a painting in a museum and says, “Brothers and sisters I
      have none, but that man&apos;s father is my father&apos;s son.” Who is
      in the painting?
