# Iconography

All our default icons are provided by [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/). We
don't import all icons to reduce the bundle size but we cherry pick a nice
selection for you to use in your application. The list of names is set down
below. To use an icon, you can use the `Icon` component and pass the name of
the icon you want to use.

<CodeBlock title="Icon component" code={`<Icon name="heart" />`} />

## Icon library
