# Layout

Canon is made for extensibility. We built this library to make it easy for any
Backstage plugin creator to be able to build their ideas at speed ensuring
consistency across the rest of your ecosystem. Each component is designed to
be editable to match your need but sometimes you want to have more control
over the layout of your page. To help you with that, we created a set of
layout components that you can use to build your own layouts. All of these
components are built to extend on our theming system, making it easy for you
to build your own layouts. Sometimes these components are not enough so we
created a set of helpers to be used with any CSS-in-JS library.

## Layout Components

We built a couple of layout components to help you build responsive elements
that will be consistent with the rest of your Backstage instance. These
components are opinionated and use TypeScript to ensure that the props you
provide are the ones coming from the theme.

<CodeBlock
  title="Layout components"
  code={`<Stack direction="column" gap="md">
    <Box>Hello World</Box>
    <Inline gap="sm">
      <Box>Project 1</Box>
      <Box>Project 2</Box>
    </Inline>
  </Stack>
`}
/>

<LayoutComponents />

## Layout Helpers

Sometimes you want to use global tokens dynamically outside of React
components. To help you with that we would like to provide a set of helpers
that you can use in your code. These helpers are not available just yet but we
are working on it.
