Welcome to the Canon, the new design library for Backstage plugins. This
project is still under active development but we will make sure to document
the API as we go. We are aiming to improve the general UI of Backstage and
plugins across Backstage. This new library will take time to build but we are
building it incrementally with not conflict with the existing theming system.

## Installation

### 1. Install canon

Install Canon using a package manager.

<CodeBlock lang="shell" code={`npm install @backstage/canon`} />

### 2. Import the css files

Import the global CSS file at the root of your application.

```tsx
import '@backstage/canon/css/core.css';
import '@backstage/canon/css/components.css';
```

### 3. Add the theme provider

Add the theme provider to your application.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@backstage/canon';

<ThemeProvider>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>;
```

### 4. Start building âœ¨

Now you can start building your plugin using the new design system.

```tsx
import { Stack, Button } from '@backstage/canon';

<Stack>
  <Text>Hello World</Text>
  <Button>Click me</Button>
</Stack>;
```

## Roadmap

You can check our roadmap [on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/backstage/projects/10). We'll do our best to keep you updated on the progress.

## Next steps

Now that you have the basics down, you can start building your plugin using the new design system.
Please familiarise yourself first with our theming principles. This will help you understand the core concepts of the design system.
