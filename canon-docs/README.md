# Canon Docs

Canon is our internal UI library built for Backstage. We built this website to document the library and its components. You can view this website [here](https://canon.backstage.io).

## How to run locally

This website is built with Next.js and it is hosted on Github pages. To run it locally, you can run the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Deployment

Deployments are done automatically when a PR is merged into the `master` branch. We host the website using Github pages.
