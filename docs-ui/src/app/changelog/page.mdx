## Version 0.1.0

We're excited to share the initial release of Backstage UI 💚 In this first alpha version,
you'll find the foundation of our design system: a set of versatile layout components
and a handful of essential atomic elements to help you get started. While Backstage UI is
still in its early stages, it's ready for exploration and we'd love for you to give
it a try and share your feedback.
