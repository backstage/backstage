# About Backstage UI

Backstage UI is a design system created specifically for Backstage, built with React, TypeScript, and vanilla CSS.
This open-source library is hosted in the Backstage monorepo. While it can be used in other projects, Backstage UI
is designed to deliver a consistent, accessible, and extensible experience tailored to Backstage users.

## Philosophy

Backstage empowers product teams to build software faster and with greater quality. Its extensibility,
however, required us to rethink how to deliver a consistent and accessible user experience. Our goal is
to enable plugin creators to design plugins that seamlessly integrate with Backstage&apos;s look and feel while
still allowing customization to match individual brands.

Instead of reinventing the wheel, we chose to focus on layout and styling while leveraging existing headless
component libraries for functionality. This approach allows us to dedicate our efforts to creating a cohesive
and flexible theming system.

## Team

Backstage UI is designed and maintained primarily by Spotify&apos;s Backstage team, leveraging Spotify&apos;s expertise in
crafting high-quality design and technology. Drawing from our experience in building reliable and intuitive
user experiences for the music industry, we&apos;ve created a design system that looks great and works seamlessly.
