# Welcome to Backstage UI

Backstage UI is a design system created specifically for Backstage, built with React, TypeScript, and vanilla CSS.
This open-source library is hosted in the Backstage monorepo. While it can be used in other projects, Backstage UI
is designed to deliver a consistent, accessible, and extensible experience tailored to Backstage users.

## Import BUI's global styles

Backstage UI works by importing a global CSS file at the root of your application. This file includes all the default styles for the components.
First, you'll need to install the package using a package manager. For example, if you're using Yarn:

<CodeBlock
  lang="shell"
  title="Run this command in your `packages/app` directory"
  code={`yarn add @backstage/ui`}
/>

<CodeBlock
  lang="tsx"
  title="Add this line to `packages/app/src/index.tsx`"
  code={`import '@backstage/cli/asset-types';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import '@backstage/ui/css/styles.css'; // [!code ++]

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(<App />);`}
/>

<Banner
  text="Import these styles only once at your application root. Plugin developers should skip this step to avoid conflicts."
  variant="warning"
/>

## Use BUI components

As a plugin maintainer, you can use BUI components in your plugin. As mentioned above, you should not import the styles
again in your plugin as this will be handled at the root of your application. To get started, just add the library to
your plugin and import the components you need.

<CodeBlock
  lang="shell"
  title="Run this command in your `packages/[your-plugin]` directory"
  code={`yarn add @backstage/ui`}
/>

<CodeBlock lang="tsx" title="Let's get started 🚀" code={snippet} />

## Support

Now that you have the basics down, you can start building your plugin using the new design system.
Please familiarise yourself first with our theming principles. This will help you understand the core concepts of the design system.

## Philosophy

Backstage empowers product teams to build software faster and with greater quality. Its extensibility,
however, required us to rethink how to deliver a consistent and accessible user experience. Our goal is
to enable plugin creators to design plugins that seamlessly integrate with Backstage&apos;s look and feel while
still allowing customization to match individual brands.

Instead of reinventing the wheel, we chose to focus on layout and styling while leveraging existing headless
component libraries for functionality. This approach allows us to dedicate our efforts to creating a cohesive
and flexible theming system.

## Team

Backstage UI is designed and maintained primarily by Spotify&apos;s Backstage team, leveraging Spotify&apos;s expertise in
crafting high-quality design and technology. Drawing from our experience in building reliable and intuitive
user experiences for the music industry, we&apos;ve created a design system that looks great and works seamlessly.
