# @backstage/techdocs-common

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- e0bfd3d44: Migrate the package to use the `ContainerRunner` interface instead of `runDockerContainer(…)`.
  It also no longer provides the `ContainerRunner` as an input to the `GeneratorBase#run(…)` function, but expects it as a constructor parameter instead.

  If you use the `TechdocsGenerator` you need to update the usage:

  ```diff
  + const containerRunner = new DockerContainerRunner({ dockerClient });

  - const generator = new TechdocsGenerator(logger, config);
  + const techdocsGenerator = new TechdocsGenerator({
  +   logger,
  +   containerRunner,
  +   config,
  + });

    await this.generator.run({
      inputDir: preparedDir,
      outputDir,
  -   dockerClient: this.dockerClient,
      parsedLocationAnnotation,
      etag: newEtag,
    });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- e9e56b01a: Adding optional config to enable S3-like API for tech-docs using s3ForcePathStyle option.
  This allows providers like LocalStack, Minio and Wasabi (+possibly others) to be used to host tech docs.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- f4af06ebe: Gracefully handle HTTP request failures in download method of AzureBlobStorage publisher.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- bc9d62f4f: Move the sanity checks of the publisher configurations to a dedicated `PublisherBase#getReadiness()` method instead of throwing an error when doing `Publisher.fromConfig(...)`.
  You should include the check when your backend to get early feedback about a potential misconfiguration:

  ```diff
    // packages/backend/src/plugins/techdocs.ts

    export default async function createPlugin({
      logger,
      config,
      discovery,
      reader,
    }: PluginEnvironment): Promise<Router> {
      // ...

      const publisher = await Publisher.fromConfig(config, {
        logger,
        discovery,
      })

  +   // checks if the publisher is working and logs the result
  +   await publisher.getReadiness();

      // Docker client (conditionally) used by the generators, based on techdocs.generators config.
      const dockerClient = new Docker();

      // ...
  }
  ```

  If you want to crash your application on invalid configurations, you can throw an `Error` to preserve the old behavior.
  Please be aware that this is not the recommended for the use in a Backstage backend but might be helpful in CLI tools such as the `techdocs-cli`.

  ```ts
  const publisher = await Publisher.fromConfig(config, {
    logger,
    discovery,
  });

  const ready = await publisher.getReadiness();
  if (!ready.isAvailable) {
    throw new Error('Invalid TechDocs publisher configuration');
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [5d0740563]
  - @backstage/catalog-model@0.7.7

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- 8686eb38c: Use errors from `@backstage/errors`
- 424742dc1: Applies only if you use TechDocs local builder instead of building on CI/CD i.e. if `techdocs.builder` in your `app-config.yaml` is set to `'local'`

  Improvements

  1. Do not check for updates in the repository if a check has been made in the last 60 seconds. This is to prevent the annoying check for update on every page switch or load.
  2. No need to maintain an in-memory etag storage, and use the one stored in `techdocs_metadata.json` file alongside generated docs.

  New feature

  1. You can now use a mix of basic and recommended setup i.e. `techdocs.builder` is `'local'` but using an external cloud storage instead of local storage. Previously, in this setup, the docs would never get updated.

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- a594a7257: @backstage/techdocs-common can now be imported in an environment without @backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend being installed.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 68ad5af51: Improve techdocs-common Generator API for it to be used by techdocs-cli. TechDocs generator.run function now takes
  an input AND an output directory. Most probably you use techdocs-common via plugin-techdocs-backend, and so there
  is no breaking change for you.
  But if you use techdocs-common separately, you need to create an output directory and pass into the generator.
- 371f67ecd: fix to-string breakage of binary files
- f1e74777a: Fix bug where binary files (`png`, etc.) could not load when using AWS or GCS publisher.
- dbe4450c3: Google Cloud authentication in TechDocs has been improved.

  1. `techdocs.publisher.googleGcs.credentials` is now optional. If it is missing, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
     environment variable (and some other methods) will be used to authenticate.
     Read more here https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production

  2. `techdocs.publisher.googleGcs.projectId` is no longer used. You can remove it from your `app-config.yaml`.

- 5826d0973: AWS SDK version bump for TechDocs.
- b3b9445df: AWS S3 authentication in TechDocs has been improved.

  1. `techdocs.publisher.awsS3.bucketName` is now the only required config. `techdocs.publisher.awsS3.credentials` and `techdocs.publisher.awsS3.region` are optional.

  2. If `techdocs.publisher.awsS3.credentials` and `techdocs.publisher.awsS3.region` are missing, the AWS environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_REGION` will be used. There are more better ways of setting up AWS authentication. Read the guide at https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/using-cloud-storage

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 8804e8981: Using @backstage/integration package for GitHub/GitLab/Azure tokens and request options.

  Most probably you do not have to make any changes in the app because of this change.
  However, if you are using the `DirectoryPreparer` or `CommonGitPreparer` exported by
  `@backstage/techdocs-common` package, you now need to add pass in a `config` (from `@backstage/config`)
  instance as argument.

  ```
  <!-- Before -->
      const directoryPreparer = new DirectoryPreparer(logger);
      const commonGitPreparer = new CommonGitPreparer(logger);
  <!-- Now -->
      const directoryPreparer = new DirectoryPreparer(config, logger);
      const commonGitPreparer = new CommonGitPreparer(config, logger);
  ```

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- a8573e53b: techdocs-backend: Simplified file, removing individual preparers and generators.
  techdocs-backend: UrlReader is now available to use in preparers.

  In your Backstage app, `packages/backend/plugins/techdocs.ts` file has now been simplified,
  to remove registering individual preparers and generators.

  Please update the file when upgrading the version of `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` package.

  ```typescript
  const preparers = await Preparers.fromConfig(config, {
    logger,
    reader,
  });

  const generators = await Generators.fromConfig(config, {
    logger,
  });

  const publisher = await Publisher.fromConfig(config, {
    logger,
    discovery,
  });
  ```

  You should be able to remove unnecessary imports, and just do

  ```typescript
  import {
    createRouter,
    Preparers,
    Generators,
    Publisher,
  } from '@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend';
  ```

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- dae4f3983: _Breaking changes_

  1. Added option to use Google Cloud Storage as a choice to store the static generated files for TechDocs.
     It can be configured using `techdocs.publisher.type` option in `app-config.yaml`.
     Step-by-step guide to configure GCS is available here https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/using-cloud-storage
     Set `techdocs.publisher.type` to `'local'` if you want to continue using local filesystem to store TechDocs files.

  2. `techdocs.builder` is now required and can be set to `'local'` or `'external'`. (Set it to `'local'` for now, since CI/CD build
     workflow for TechDocs will be available soon (in few weeks)).
     If builder is set to 'local' and you open a TechDocs page, `techdocs-backend` will try to generate the docs, publish to storage and
     show the generated docs afterwords.
     If builder is set to `'external'`, `techdocs-backend` will only fetch the docs and will NOT try to generate and publish. In this case of `'external'`,
     we assume that docs are being built in the CI/CD pipeline of the repository.
     TechDocs will not assume a default value for `techdocs.builder`. It is better to explicitly define it in the `app-config.yaml`.

  3. When configuring TechDocs in your backend, there is a difference in how a new publisher is created.

  ```
  ---  const publisher = new LocalPublish(logger, discovery);
  +++  const publisher = Publisher.fromConfig(config, logger, discovery);
  ```

  Based on the config `techdocs.publisher.type`, the publisher could be either Local publisher or Google Cloud Storage publisher.

  4. `techdocs.storageUrl` is now a required config. Should be `http://localhost:7000/api/techdocs/static/docs` in most setups.

  5. Parts of `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` have been moved to a new package `@backstage/techdocs-common` to generate docs. Also to publish docs
     to-and-fro between TechDocs and a storage (either local or external). However, a Backstage app does NOT need to import the `techdocs-common` package -
     app should only import `@backstage/plugin-techdocs` and `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend`.

  _Patch changes_

  1. See all of TechDocs config options and its documentation https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/configuration

  2. Logic about serving static files and metadata retrieval have been abstracted away from the router in `techdocs-backend` to the instance of publisher.

  3. Removed Material UI Spinner from TechDocs header. Spinners cause unnecessary UX distraction.
     Case 1 (when docs are built and are to be served): Spinners appear for a split second before the name of site shows up. This unnecessarily distracts eyes because spinners increase the size of the Header. A dot (.) would do fine. Definitely more can be done.
     Case 2 (when docs are being generated): There is already a linear progress bar (which is recommended in Storybook).
