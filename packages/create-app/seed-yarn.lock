# yarn lockfile v1

// This file is used to seed the yarn.lock file in newly created projects.
// It can be used to work around issues in new dependency versions that would otherwise
// both break new apps and the E2E tests in this repo.
//
// In @backstage/create-app this file is read directly from the repo, rather than from
// the published package. In the E2E tests it's instead loaded directly from the workspace.
// Lines starting with "//" are trimmed, so they can be used to add extra context to the entries.
//
// To add a new entry, run and commit the result:
//
//   yarn add-lock-seed <package> <query> <version>
//
// package: the name of the package, e.g. @testing-library/react
// query: the version query to pin the version for, e.g. ^14.0.0
// version: the version to pin to, must be in range of the query, e.g. 14.11.0
