      # about setting up the GitHub integration here: https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/github/locations#configuration

    ### Example for how to add your GitHub Enterprise instance using the API:
    # - host: ghe.example.net
    #   apiBaseUrl: https://ghe.example.net/api/v3
    #   token: ${GHE_TOKEN}

proxy:
  ### Example for how to add a proxy endpoint for the frontend.
  ### A typical reason to do this is to handle HTTPS and CORS for internal services.
  # endpoints:
  #   '/test':
  #     target: 'https://example.com'
  #     changeOrigin: true
