# example-app

This package is an example of a Backstage application using
the [New Frontend System](https://backstage.io/docs/frontend-system/).

To play with it, open a terminal and run the command: `yarn start`

**NOTE:** Don't forget to open a second terminal and to launch the backend there, using `yarn start`! The frontend
requires a backend to connect to.
