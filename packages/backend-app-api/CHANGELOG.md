## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- ffd1f4a: Plugin lifecycle shutdown hooks are now performed before root lifecycle shutdown hooks.
- fd6e6f4: build(deps): bump `cookie` from 0.6.0 to 0.7.0
- 094eaa3: Remove references to in-repo backend-common
- 04af116: The backend will no longer exit immediately if any plugin or modules fails to initialize. Instead, the backend will wait for all plugins and modules to either start up successfully or throw, and then shut down the backend if there were any initialization errors.

  This fixes an issue where backend initialization errors in adjacent plugins during database schema migration could cause the database migrations to be stuck in a locked state.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- ec1b4be: Release 1.0 of the new backend system! :tada:

  The backend system is finally getting promoted to 1.0.0. This means that the API is now stable and breaking changes should not occur until version 2.0.0, see our [package versioning policy](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/versioning-policy/#package-versioning-policy) for more information what this means.

  This release also marks the end of the old backend system based on `createRouter` exports. Going forward backend plugins packages will start to deprecate and later this year remove exports supporting the old backend system. If you would like to help out with this transition, see https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/26353 or consult the [migration guide](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/building-plugins-and-modules/migrating/#remove-support-for-the-old-backend-system).

### Minor Changes

- 19ff127: **BREAKING**: The deprecated `identityServiceFactory` and `tokenManagerServiceFactory` have been removed.
- d425fc4: **BREAKING**: The return values from `createBackendPlugin`, `createBackendModule`, and `createServiceFactory` are now simply `BackendFeature` and `ServiceFactory`, instead of the previously deprecated form of a function that returns them. For this reason, `createServiceFactory` also no longer accepts the callback form where you provide direct options to the service. This also affects all `coreServices.*` service refs.

  This may in particular affect tests; if you were effectively doing `createBackendModule({...})()` (note the parentheses), you can now remove those extra parentheses at the end. You may encounter cases of this in your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` too, where you add plugins, modules, and services. If you were using `createServiceFactory` with a function as its argument for the purpose of passing in options, this pattern has been deprecated for a while and is no longer supported. You may want to explore the new multiton patterns to achieve your goals, or moving settings to app-config.

  As part of this change, the `IdentityFactoryOptions` type was removed, and can no longer be used to tweak that service. The identity service was also deprecated some time ago, and you will want to [migrate to the new auth system](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/auth-service-migration) if you still rely on it.

### Patch Changes

- cd38da8: Deprecate the `featureDiscoveryServiceFactory` in favor of using `@backstage/backend-defaults#discoveryFeatureLoader` instead.
- 8ccf784: All created backend instances now share a the same `process` exit listeners, and on exit the process will wait for all backend instances to shut down before exiting. This fixes the `EventEmitter` leak warnings in tests.
- 6ed9264: chore(deps): bump `path-to-regexp` from 6.2.2 to 8.0.0
- c246372: Updated the error message for missing service dependencies to include the plugin and module IDs.
- 7f779c7: `auth.externalAccess` should be optional in the config schema
- c2b63ab: Updated dependency `supertest` to `^7.0.0`.
- 51a69b5: Fix feature loaders in CJS double-default nested builds
- 0b2a402: Updates to the config schema to match reality

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 1cb84d7: **BREAKING**: Removed the depreacted `getPath` option from `httpRouterServiceFactory`, as well as the `HttpRouterFactoryOptions` type.
- f691c9b: **BREAKING**: Removed the ability to pass callback-form service factories through the `defaultServiceFactories` option of `createSpecializedBackend`. This is an immediate breaking change as usage of this function is expected to be very rare.

### Patch Changes

- 2f99178: The `ServiceFactoryTest.get` method was deprecated and the `ServiceFactoryTest.getSubject` should be used instead. The `getSubject` method has the same behavior, but has a better method name to indicate that the service instance returned is the subject currently being tested.
- b05e1e1: Service factories exported by this package have been updated to use the new service factory format that doesn't use a callback.
- 617a7d2: Internal refactor that avoids the use of service factory options.
- b60db08: Fixing exporting of classes properly from new packages
- 18b96b1: The ability to install backend features in callback form (`() => BackendFeature`) has been deprecated. This typically means that you need to update the installed features to use the latest version of `@backstage/backend-plugin-api`. If the feature is from a third-party package, please reach out to the package maintainer to update it.

## 0.7.6

### Patch Changes

- b7de623: Fixed a potential crash when passing an object with a `null` prototype as log meta.
- 9539a0b: Deprecated `authServiceFactory`, `httpAuthServiceFactory`, and `userInfoServiceFactory`. Please import them from `@backstage/backend-defaults/auth`, `@backstage/backend-defaults/httpAuth`, and `@backstage/backend-defaults/userInfo` respectively instead.
- 3e823d3: Limited user tokens will no longer include the `ent` field in its payload. Ownership claims will now be fetched from the user info service.

  NOTE: Limited tokens issued prior to this change will no longer be valid. Users may have to clear their browser cookies in order to refresh their auth tokens.

- 78a0b08: Internal refactor to handle `BackendFeature` contract change.
- 398b82a: Add support for JWKS tokens in ExternalTokenHandler.
- 9e63318: Added an optional `accessRestrictions` to external access service tokens and service principals in general, such that you can limit their access to certain plugins or permissions.
- e25e467: Added a new static key based method for plugin-to-plugin auth. This is useful for example if you are running readonly service nodes that cannot use a database for the default public-key signature scheme outlined in [BEP-0003](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/beps/0003-auth-architecture-evolution). Most users should want to stay on the more secure zero-config database signature scheme.

  You can generate a public and private key pair using `openssl`.

  - First generate a private key using the ES256 algorithm

    ```sh
    openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -out private.ec.key
    ```

  - Convert it to PKCS#8 format

    ```sh
    openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in private.ec.key -out private.key
    ```

  - Extract the public key

    ```sh
    openssl ec -inform PEM -outform PEM -pubout -in private.key -out public.key
    ```

  After this you have the files `private.key` and `public.key`. Put them in a place where you know their absolute paths, and then set up your app-config accordingly:

  ```yaml
  backend:
    auth:
      keyStore:
        type: static
        static:
          keys:
            - publicKeyFile: /absolute/path/to/public.key
              privateKeyFile: /absolute/path/to/private.key
              keyId: some-custom-id
  ```

- 7d30d95: Fixing issue with log meta fields possibly being circular refs
- 6a576dc: Stop using `getVoidLogger` in tests to reduce the dependency on the soon-to-deprecate `backstage-common` package.
- 6551b3d: Deprecated core service factories and implementations and moved them over to
  subpath exports on `@backstage/backend-defaults` instead. E.g.
  `@backstage/backend-defaults/scheduler` is where the service factory and default
  implementation of `coreServices.scheduler` now lives.

## 0.7.6-next.0

### Patch Changes

- b7de623: Fixed a potential crash when passing an object with a `null` prototype as log meta.
- 7d30d95: Fixing issue with log meta fields possibly being circular refs
- 6a576dc: Stop using `getVoidLogger` in tests to reduce the dependency on the soon-to-deprecate `backstage-common` package.
- 6551b3d: Deprecated core service factories and implementations and moved them over to
  subpath exports on `@backstage/backend-defaults` instead. E.g.
  `@backstage/backend-defaults/scheduler` is where the service factory and default
  implementation of `coreServices.scheduler` now lives.

## 0.7.3

### Patch Changes

- 4cd5ff0: Add ability to configure the Node.js HTTP Server when configuring the root HTTP Router service
- e8199b1: Move the JWKS registration outside of the lifecycle middleware
- d229dc4: Move path utilities from `backend-common` to the `backend-plugin-api` package.
- dc8c5dd: The default `TokenManager` implementation no longer requires keys to be configured in production, but it will throw an errors when generating or authenticating tokens. The default `AuthService` implementation will now also provide additional context if such an error is throw when falling back to using the `TokenManager` service to generate tokens for outgoing requests.
- 025641b: Redact `meta` fields too with the logger
- 09f8988: Remove explicit `alg` check for user tokens in `verifyToken`
- 5863e02: Internal refactor to only create one external token handler
- a1dc547: Added support for camel case CSP directives in app-config. For example:

  ```yaml
  backend:
    csp:
      upgradeInsecureRequests: false
  ```

- 329cc34: Added logging of all plugins being initialized, periodic status, and completion.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 3256f14: **BREAKING**: Modules are no longer loaded unless the plugin that they extend is present.

### Patch Changes

- 10327fb: Deprecate the `getPath` option for the `httpRouterServiceFactory` and more generally the ability to configure plugin API paths to be anything else than `/api/:pluginId/`. Requests towards `/api/*` that do not match an installed plugin will also no longer be handled by the index router, typically instead returning a 404.
- 2c50516: Fix auth cookie issuance for split backend deployments by preferring to set it against the request target host instead of origin
- 7e584d6: Fixed a bug where expired cookies would not be refreshed.
- 1a20b12: Make the auth service create and validate dedicated OBO tokens, containing the user identity proof.
- 00fca28: Implemented support for external access using both the legacy token form and static tokens.
- d5a1fe1: Replaced winston logger with `LoggerService`
- bce0879: Service-to-service authentication has been improved.

  Each plugin now has the capability to generate its own signing keys for token issuance. The generated public keys are stored in a database, and they are made accessible through a newly created endpoint: `/.backstage/auth/v1/jwks.json`.

  `AuthService` can now issue tokens with a reduced scope using the `getPluginRequestToken` method. This improvement enables plugins to identify the plugin originating the request.

- 54f2ac8: Added `initialization` option to `createServiceFactory` which defines the initialization strategy for the service. The default strategy mimics the current behavior where plugin scoped services are initialized lazily by default and root scoped services are initialized eagerly.
- 56f81b5: Improved error message thrown by `AuthService` when requesting a token for plugins that don't support the new authentication tokens.
- 25ea3d2: Minor internal restructuring
- d62bc51: Add support for limited user tokens by using user identity proof provided by the auth backend.
- c884b9a: Automatically creates a get and delete cookie endpoint when a `user-cookie` policy is added.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a3d434: **BREAKING**: For users that have migrated to the new backend system, incoming requests will now be rejected if they are not properly authenticated (e.g. with a Backstage bearer token or a backend token). Please see the [Auth Service Migration tutorial](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/auth-service-migration) for more information on how to circumvent this behavior in the short term and how to properly leverage it in the longer term.

  Added service factories for the new [`auth`](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/core-services/auth/), [`httpAuth`](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/core-services/http-auth), and [`userInfo`](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/core-services/user-info) services that were created as part of [BEP-0003](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/beps/0003-auth-architecture-evolution).

### Patch Changes

- 999224f: Bump dependency `minimatch` to v9
- 81e0120: Fixed an issue where configuration schema for the purpose of redacting secrets from logs was not being read correctly.
- 15fda44: Provide some sane defaults for `WinstonLogger.create` making some of the arguments optional
- 0502d82: Updated the `permissionsServiceFactory` to forward the `AuthService` to the implementation.
- 9d91128: Add the possibility to disable watching files in the new backend system
- a5d341e: Adds an initial rate-limiting implementation so that any incoming requests that have a `'none'` principal are rate-limited automatically.
- 9802004: Made the `DefaultUserInfoService` claims check stricter
- f235ca7: Make sure to not filter out schemas in `createConfigSecretEnumerator`
- af5f7a6: The experimental feature discovery service exported at the `/alpha` sub-path will no longer attempt to load packages that are not Backstage backend packages.

- 154632d8753b: Add support for discovering additional service factories during startup.
- 37a20c7f14aa: Adds include and exclude configuration to feature discovery of backend packages
  Adds alpha modules to feature discovery
- cb7fc410ed99: The experimental backend feature discovery now only considers default exports from packages. It no longer filters packages to include based on the package role, except that `'cli'` packages are ignored. However, the `"backstage"` field is still required in `package.json`.
- 3fc64b9e2f8f: Extension points are now tracked via their ID rather than reference, in order to support package duplication.
- 3b30b179cb38: Add support for installing features as package imports, for example `backend.add(import('my-plugin'))`.
- b219d097b3f4: Backend startup will now fail if any circular service dependencies are detected.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- b9c57a4f857e: **BREAKING**: Renamed `configServiceFactory` to `rootConfigServiceFactory`.
- a6d7983f349c: **BREAKING**: Removed the `services` option from `createBackend`. Service factories are now `BackendFeature`s and should be installed with `backend.add(...)` instead. The following should be migrated:

  ```ts
  const backend = createBackend({ services: [myCustomServiceFactory] });
  ```

  To instead pass the service factory via `backend.add(...)`:

  ```ts
  const backend = createBackend();
  backend.add(customRootLoggerServiceFactory);
  ```

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 02b119ff93: **BREAKING**: The `httpRouterFactory` now accepts a `getPath` option rather than `indexPlugin`. To set up custom index path, configure the new `rootHttpRouterFactory` with a custom `indexPath` instead.

  Added an implementation for the new `rootHttpRouterServiceRef`.

### Patch Changes

- ecc6bfe4c9: Use new `ServiceFactoryOrFunction` type.
- b99c030f1b: Moved over implementation of the root HTTP service from `@backstage/backend-common`, and replaced the `middleware` option with a `configure` callback option.
- 170282ece6: Fixed a bug in the default token manager factory where it created multiple incompatible instances.
- 843a0a158c: Added service factory for the new core identity service.
- 150a7dd790: An error will now be thrown if attempting to override the plugin metadata service.
- 483e907eaf: Internal updates of `createServiceFactory` from `@backstage/backend-plugin-api`.
- 015a6dced6: The `createSpecializedBackend` function will now throw an error if duplicate service implementations are provided.
- e3fca10038: Tweaked the plugin logger to use `plugin` as the label for the plugin ID, rather than `pluginId`.
- ecbec4ec4c: Internal refactor to match new options pattern in the experimental backend system.
- 51b7a7ed07: Exported the default root HTTP router implementation as `DefaultRootHttpRouter`. It only implements the routing layer and needs to be exposed via an HTTP server similar to the built-in setup in the `rootHttpRouterFactory`.
- 0e63aab311: Moved over logging and configuration loading implementations from `@backstage/backend-common`. There is a now `WinstonLogger` which implements the `RootLoggerService` through Winston with accompanying utilities. For configuration the `loadBackendConfig` function has been moved over, but it now instead returns an object with a `config` property.
- 8e06f3cf00: Switched imports of `loggerToWinstonLogger` to `@backstage/backend-common`.
- 3b8fd4169b: Internal folder structure refactor.
