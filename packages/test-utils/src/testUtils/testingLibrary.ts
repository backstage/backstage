 * Simplifies rendering of async components in by taking care of the wrapping inside act
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * Components using useEffect to perform an asynchronous action (such as fetch) must be rendered within an async
 * act call to properly get the final state, even with mocked responses. This utility method makes the signature a bit
 * cleaner, since act doesn't return the result of the evaluated function.
