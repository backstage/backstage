# {{pluginId}}

Welcome to the {{pluginId}} plugin!

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the app in this repository, meaning you'll be able
to access it by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating
to [/{{pluginId}}](http://localhost:3000/{{pluginId}}).

This plugin is built with Backstage's [new frontend
system](https://backstage.io/docs/frontend-system/architecture/index), and you
can find more information about building plugins in the [plugin builder
documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/frontend-system/building-plugins/index).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
