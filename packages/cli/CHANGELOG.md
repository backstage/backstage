## 0.7.6

### Patch Changes

- 9d40fcb1e: - Bumping `material-ui/core` version to at least `4.12.2` as they made some breaking changes in later versions which broke `Pagination` of the `Table`.
  - Switching out `material-table` to `@material-table/core` for support for the later versions of `material-ui/core`
  - This causes a minor API change to `@backstage/core-components` as the interface for `Table` re-exports the `prop` from the underlying `Table` components.
  - `onChangeRowsPerPage` has been renamed to `onRowsPerPageChange`
  - `onChangePage` has been renamed to `onPageChange`
  - Migration guide is here: https://material-table-core.com/docs/breaking-changes

- 48c9fcd33: Migrated to use the new `@backstage/core-*` packages rather than `@backstage/core`.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 3108ff7bf: Make `yarn dev` in newly created backend plugins respect the `PLUGIN_PORT` environment variable.

  You can achieve the same in your created backend plugins by making sure to properly call the port and CORS methods on your service builder. Typically in a file named `src/service/standaloneServer.ts` inside your backend plugin package, replace the following:

  ```ts
  const service = createServiceBuilder(module)
    .enableCors({ origin: 'http://localhost:3000' })
    .addRouter('/my-plugin', router);
  ```

  With something like the following:

  ```ts
  let service = createServiceBuilder(module)
    .setPort(options.port)
    .addRouter('/my-plugin', router);
  if (options.enableCors) {
    service = service.enableCors({ origin: 'http://localhost:3000' });
  }
  ```

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.6.4

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 9cd3c533c: Switch from `ts-jest` to `@sucrase/jest-plugin`, improving performance and aligning transpilation with bundling.

  In order to switch back to `ts-jest`, install `ts-jest@^26.4.3` as a dependency in the root of your repo and add the following in the root `package.json`:

  ```json
  "jest": {
    "globals": {
      "ts-jest": {
        "isolatedModules": true
      }
    },
    "transform": {
      "\\.esm\\.js$": "@backstage/cli/config/jestEsmTransform.js",
      "\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$": "ts-jest",
      "\\.(bmp|gif|jpg|jpeg|png|frag|xml|svg)$": "@backstage/cli/config/jestFileTransform.js",
      "\\.(yaml)$": "yaml-jest"
    }
  }
  ```

  Note that this will override the default jest transforms included with the `@backstage/cli`.

  It is possible that some test code needs a small migration as a result of this change, which stems from a difference in how `sucrase` and `ts-jest` transform module re-exports.

  Consider the following code:

  ```ts
  import * as utils from './utils';

  jest.spyOn(utils, 'myUtility').mockReturnValue(3);
  ```

  If the `./utils` import for example refers to an index file that in turn re-exports from `./utils/myUtility`, you would have to change the code to the following to work around the fact that the exported object from `./utils` ends up not having configurable properties, thus breaking `jest.spyOn`.

  ```ts
  import * as utils from './utils/myUtility';

  jest.spyOn(utils, 'myUtility').mockReturnValue(3);
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 7f7443308: Updated dependencies
- 21e8ebef5: Fix error message formatting in the packaging process.

  error.errors can be undefined which will lead to a TypeError, swallowing the actual error message in the process.

  For instance, if you break your tsconfig.json with invalid syntax, backstage-cli will not be able to build anything and it will be very hard to find out why because the underlying error message is hidden behind a TypeError.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 19fe61c27: We have updated the default `eslint` rules in the `@backstage/cli` package.

  ```diff
  -'@typescript-eslint/no-shadow': 'off',
  -'@typescript-eslint/no-redeclare': 'off',
  +'no-shadow': 'off',
  +'no-redeclare': 'off',
  +'@typescript-eslint/no-shadow': 'error',
  +'@typescript-eslint/no-redeclare': 'error',
  ```

  The rules are documented [here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-shadow) and [here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-redeclare).

  This involved a large number of small changes to the code base. When you compile your own code using the CLI, you may also be
  affected. We consider these rules important, and the primary recommendation is to try to update your code according to the
  documentation above. But those that prefer to not enable the rules, or need time to perform the updates, may update their
  local `.eslintrc.js` file(s) in the repo root and/or in individual plugins as they see fit:

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    // ... other declarations
    rules: {
      '@typescript-eslint/no-shadow': 'off',
      '@typescript-eslint/no-redeclare': 'off',
    },
  };
  ```

  Because of the nature of this change, we're unable to provide a grace period for the update :(

### Patch Changes

- 398e1f83e: Update `create-plugin` template to use the new composability API, by switching to exporting a single routable extension component.
- e9aab60c7: Fixed module resolution of external libraries during backend development. Modules used to be resolved relative to the backend entrypoint, but are now resolved relative to each individual module.
- a08c4b0b0: Add check for outdated/duplicate packages to yarn start
- Updated dependencies [062df71db]
- Updated dependencies [e9aab60c7]
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.5.1

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 12a56cdfe: We've bumped the `@eslint-typescript` packages to the latest, which now add some additional rules that might cause lint failures.
  The main one which could become an issue is the [no-use-before-define](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-use-before-define) rule.

  Every plugin and app has the ability to override these rules if you want to ignore them for now.

  You can reset back to the default behaviour by using the following in your own `.eslint.js`

  ```js
  rules: {
    'no-use-before-define': 'off'
  }
  ```

  Because of the nature of this change, we're unable to provide a grace period for the update :(

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1722cb53c: Added support for loading and validating configuration schemas, as well as declaring config visibility through schemas.

  The new `loadConfigSchema` function exported by `@backstage/config-loader` allows for the collection and merging of configuration schemas from all nearby dependencies of the project.

  A configuration schema is declared using the `https://backstage.io/schema/config-v1` JSON Schema meta schema, which is based on draft07. The only difference to the draft07 schema is the custom `visibility` keyword, which is used to indicate whether the given config value should be visible in the frontend or not. The possible values are `frontend`, `backend`, and `secret`, where `backend` is the default. A visibility of `secret` has the same scope at runtime, but it will be treated with more care in certain contexts, and defining both `frontend` and `secret` for the same value in two different schemas will result in an error during schema merging.

  Packages that wish to contribute configuration schema should declare it in a root `"configSchema"` field in `package.json`. The field can either contain an inlined JSON schema, or a relative path to a schema file. Schema files can be in either `.json` or `.d.ts` format.

  TypeScript configuration schema files should export a single `Config` type, for example:

  ```ts
  export interface Config {
    app: {
      /**
       * Frontend root URL
       * @visibility frontend
       */
      baseUrl: string;
    };
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 1722cb53c: Added configuration schema
- 902340451: Support specifying listen host/port for frontend
- Updated dependencies [1722cb53c]
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 28edd7d29: Create backend plugin through CLI
- 1d0aec70f: Upgrade dependency `esbuild@0.7.7`
- 72f6cda35: Adds a new `BACKSTAGE_CLI_BUILD_PARELLEL` environment variable to control
  parallelism for some build steps.

  This is useful in CI to help avoid out of memory issues when using `terser`. The
  `BACKSTAGE_CLI_BUILD_PARELLEL` environment variable can be set to
  `true | false | [integer]` to override the default behaviour. See
  [terser-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin#parallel)
  for more details.

- 8c2b76e45: **BREAKING CHANGE**

  The existing loading of additional config files like `app-config.development.yaml` using APP_ENV or NODE_ENV has been removed.
  Instead, the CLI and backend process now accept one or more `--config` flags to load config files.

  Without passing any flags, `app-config.yaml` and, if it exists, `app-config.local.yaml` will be loaded.
  If passing any `--config <path>` flags, only those files will be loaded, **NOT** the default `app-config.yaml` one.

  The old behaviour of for example `APP_ENV=development` can be replicated using the following flags:

  ```bash
  --config ../../app-config.yaml --config ../../app-config.development.yaml
  ```

- 8afce088a: Use APP_ENV before NODE_ENV for determining what config to load
