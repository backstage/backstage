## 0.30.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- cb76663: **BREAKING**: Add support for native ESM in Node.js code. This changes the behavior of dynamic import expressions in Node.js code. Typically this can be fixed by replacing `import(...)` with `require(...)`, with an `as typeof import(...)` cast if needed for types. This is because dynamic imports will no longer be transformed to `require(...)` calls, but instead be left as-is. This in turn allows you to load ESM modules from CommonJS code using `import(...)`.

  This change adds support for the following in Node.js packages, across type checking, package builds, runtime transforms and Jest tests:

  - Dynamic imports that load ESM modules from CommonJS code.
  - Both `.mjs` and `.mts` files as explicit ESM files, as well as `.cjs` and `.cts` as explicit CommonJS files.
  - Support for the `"type": "module"` field in `package.json` to indicate that the package is an ESM package.

  There are a few caveats to be aware of:

  - To enable support for native ESM in tests, you need to run the tests with the `--experimental-vm-modules` flag enabled, typically via `NODE_OPTIONS='--experimental-vm-modules'`.
  - Declaring a package as `"type": "module"` in `package.json` is supported, but in tests it will cause all local transitive dependencies to also be treated as ESM, regardless of whether they declare `"type": "module"` or not.
  - Node.js has an [ESM interoperability layer with CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/esm.html#interoperability-with-commonjs) that allows for imports from ESM to identify named exports in CommonJS packages. This interoperability layer is **only** enabled when importing packages with a `.cts` or `.cjs` extension. This is because the interoperability layer is not fully compatible with the NPM ecosystem, and would break package if it was enabled for `.js` files.
  - Dynamic imports of CommonJS packages will vary in shape depending on the runtime, i.e. test vs local development, etc. It is therefore recommended to avoid dynamic imports of CommonJS packages and instead use `require`, or to use the explicit CommonJS extensions as mentioned above. If you do need to dynamically import CommonJS packages, avoid using `default` exports, as the shape of them vary across different environments and you would otherwise need to manually unwrap the import based on the shape of the module object.

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- bc47b17: **BREAKING**: Updates ESLint config to ignore all generated source code under `src/**/generated/**/*.ts`.
- 6819f8c: Added a new optimization to the `repo test` command that will filter out unused packages in watch mode if all provide filters are paths that point from the repo root. This significantly speeds up running individual tests from the repo root in a large workspace, for example:

  ```sh
  yarn test packages/app/src/App.test.tsx
  ```

- d849865: The package packing now populates `typesVersions` for additional entry points rather than using additional `package.json` files for type resolution. This improves auto completion of separate entry points when consuming published packages.
- bc71665: **BREAKING**: The `LEGACY_BACKEND_START` flag has been removed, along with support for `src/run.ts` as the development entry point.

### Patch Changes

- 4046d53: Fixed an issue where the `--successCache` option for the `repo test` and `repo lint` commands would be include the workspace path in generated cache keys. This previously broke caching in environments where the workspace path varies across builds.
- 4a378d3: Fix dev server reloads of plugin discovery for new frontend system.
- 28b60ad: The check for `react-dom/client` in the Jest configuration will now properly always run from the target directory.
- 6b2888c: Fixed an issue with the `--successCache` flag for `repo test` where the tree hash for the wrong package directory would sometimes be used to generate the cache key.
- e30b65d: Added `--alwaysPack` as a replacement for the now hidden `--alwaysYarnPack` flag for the `build-workspace` command.
- be0278e: Removed circular import
- a7f97e4: Added a new `"rejectFrontendNetworkRequests"` configuration flag that can be set in the `"jest"` field in the root `package.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "jest": {
      "rejectFrontendNetworkRequests": true
    }
  }
  ```

  This flag causes rejection of any form of network requests that are attempted to be made in frontend or common package tests. This flag can only be set in the root `package.json` and can not be overridden in individual package configurations.

- 6c48ebd: Add `--max-warnings -1` support to `backstage-cli package lint`
- 04297a0: The `--successCache` option for the `repo test` and `repo lint` commands now use an additive store that keeps old entries around for a week before they are cleaned up automatically.
- a2f0559: When using the experimental Rspack flag the app build and dev server now injects configuration via a `<script type="backstage.io/config">...</script>` tag in `index.html` rather than the `process.env.APP_CONFIG` definition, which will now be defined as an empty array instead.

  This requires the app to be using the config loader from the 1.31 release of Backstage. Make sure your app is using at least that version if you are upgrading to this version of the CLI.

  If you have copied the implementation of the `defaultConfigLoader`, make sure to update it to the new implementation. In particular the config loader needs to be able to read configuration from `script` tags with the type `backstage.io/config`.

- b4627f2: Fixed an issue where the `raw-loader` for loading HTML templates was not resolved from the context of the CLI package.
- cd1ef2b: Updated dependency `vite` to `^5.0.0`.
- 23f1da2: Updated dependency `ts-morph` to `^24.0.0`.
- b533056: Updated dependency `css-loader` to `^7.0.0`.
- be008c3: Updated dependency `@module-federation/enhanced` to `^0.7.0`.
- 6266ed3: Updated dependency `del` to `^8.0.0`.
- 4046d53: Fixed an issue with the `repo lint` command where the cache key for the `--successCache` option would not properly ignore files that should be ignored according to `.eslintignore`s.
- e19c53c: Fix for the `--link` flag for `package start` to deduplicate `react-router` and `react-router-dom`.
- 17850a5: Update upgrade-helper link in `versions:bump` command to include `yarnPlugin` parameter when the yarn plugin is installed
- 09ea093: Fixed an issue where `.css` style injection would fail for published packages.
- 702f41d: Bumped dev dependencies `@types/node`
- 5d74716: Remove unused backend-common dependency
- b084f5a: Bump the Webpack dependency range to `^5.94.0`, as our current configuration is not compatible with some older versions.
- e565f73: Added support for `.webp` files in the frontend tooling.
- 946fa34: Added a new `--link <workspace-path>` option for frontend builds that allow you to override module resolution to link in an external workspace at runtime.

  As part of this change the Webpack linked workspace resolution plugin for frontend builds has been removed. It was in place to support the old workspace linking where it was done by Yarn, which is no longer a working option.

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- 264058c: The `repo test` command will no longer default to watch mode if the `--since` flag is provided.
- 55b8b84: **BREAKING**: The Jest configuration defined at `@backstage/cli/config/jest` no longer collects configuration defined in the `"jest"` field from all parent `package.json` files. Instead, it will only read and merge configuration from the `package.json` in the monorepo root if it exists, as well as the target package. In addition, configuration defined in the root `package.json` will now only be merged into each package configuration if it is a valid project-level configuration key.
- 6129076: **BREAKING**: Removed the following deprecated commands:

  - `create`: Use `backstage-cli new` instead
  - `create-plugin`: Use `backstage-cli new` instead
  - `plugin:diff`: Use `backstage-cli fix` instead
  - `test`: Use `backstage-cli repo test` or `backstage-cli package test` instead
  - `versions:check`: Use `yarn dedupe` or `yarn-deduplicate` instead
  - `clean`: Use `backstage-cli package clean` instead

  In addition, the experimental `install` and `onboard` commands have been removed since they have not received any updates since their introduction and we're expecting usage to be low. If you where relying on these commands, please let us know by opening an issue towards the main Backstage repository.

### Patch Changes

- ea16633: Preserve directory structure for CommonJS build output, just like ESM. This makes the build output more stable and easier to browse, and allows for more effective tree shaking and lazy imports.
- 520a383: Added functionality to the prepack script that will append the default export type for entry points to the `exports` object before publishing. This is to help with identifying the declarative integration points for plugins without needing to fetch or run the plugins first.
- 9625a97: The `scaffolder-module` template has been updated to use a more modern layout and new testing utilities for scaffolder actions.
- 03810d2: Remove unknown dependency `diff`
- cebee4f: Added support for a new experimental `EXPERIMENTAL_TRIM_NEXT_ENTRY` flag which removes any `./next` entry points present in packages when building and publishing.
- 54c8aa3: The check for `react-dom/client` will now properly always run from the target directory.
- b676cc9: feat: experimentally support using rspack instead under `EXPERIMENTAL_RSPACK` env flag
- 094eaa3: Remove references to in-repo backend-common
- 95999c5: The backend plugin template for the `new` command has been updated to provide more guidance and use a more modern structure.
- 7955f9b: Tweaked the new package feature detection to not be active when building backend packages.
- 4bfc2ce: Updated the Vite implementation behind the `EXPERIMENTAL_VITE` flag to work with more recent versions of Backstage.
- 720a2f9: Updated dependency `git-url-parse` to `^15.0.0`.
- 8f0898b: Updated dependency `esbuild` to `^0.24.0`.
- 2c5ecf5: Support `--max-warnings` flag for package linting
- 88407c3: Running `repo lint` with the `--successCache` flag now respects `.gitinore`, and it ignores projects without a `lint` script.
- 8fe740d: Added a new `--successCache` option to the `backstage-cli repo test` and `backstage-cli repo lint` commands. The cache keeps track of successful runs and avoids re-running for individual packages if they haven't changed. This option is intended only to be used in CI.

  In addition a `--successCacheDir <path>` option has also been added to be able to override the default cache directory.

- 55b8b84: The Jest configuration will now search for a `src/setupTests.*` file with any valid script extension, not only `.ts`.
- 79ba5a8: The `LEGACY_BACKEND_START` flag is now deprecated.
- f0514c7: Disabled parsing of input source maps in the SWC transform for Jest.

- 8fe740d: Added a new `--successCache` option to the `backstage-cli repo test` and `backstage-cli repo lint` commands. The cache keeps track of successful runs and avoids re-running for individual packages if they haven't changed. This option is intended only to be used in CI.

  In addition a `--successCacheDir <path>` option has also been added to be able to override the default cache directory.

- f0514c7: Disabled parsing of input source maps in the SWC transform for Jest.

## 0.28.0-next.1

### Minor Changes

- 55b8b84: **BREAKING**: The Jest configuration defined at `@backstage/cli/config/jest` no longer collects configuration defined in the `"jest"` field from all parent `package.json` files. Instead, it will only read and merge configuration from the `package.json` in the monorepo root if it exists, as well as the target package. In addition, configuration defined in the root `package.json` will now only be merged into each package configuration if it is a valid project-level configuration key.

### Patch Changes

- 03810d2: Remove unknown dependency `diff`
- cebee4f: Added support for a new experimental `EXPERIMENTAL_TRIM_NEXT_ENTRY` flag which removes any `./next` entry points present in packages when building and publishing.
- 55b8b84: The Jest configuration will now search for a `src/setupTests.*` file with any valid script extension, not only `.ts`.

## 0.28.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- 6129076: **BREAKING**: Removed the following deprecated commands:

  - `create`: Use `backstage-cli new` instead
  - `create-plugin`: Use `backstage-cli new` instead
  - `plugin:diff`: Use `backstage-cli fix` instead
  - `test`: Use `backstage-cli repo test` or `backstage-cli package test` instead
  - `versions:check`: Use `yarn dedupe` or `yarn-deduplicate` instead
  - `clean`: Use `backstage-cli package clean` instead

  In addition, the experimental `install` and `onboard` commands have been removed since they have not received any updates since their introduction and we're expecting usage to be low. If you where relying on these commands, please let us know by opening an issue towards the main Backstage repository.

### Patch Changes

- 520a383: Added functionality to the prepack script that will append the default export type for entry points to the `exports` object before publishing. This is to help with identifying the declarative integration points for plugins without needing to fetch or run the plugins first.
- 094eaa3: Remove references to in-repo backend-common
- 79ba5a8: The `LEGACY_BACKEND_START` flag is now deprecated.

## 0.27.1

### Patch Changes

- d2d2313: Add `config.d.ts` files to the list of included file in `tsconfig.json`.

  This allows ESLint to detect issues or deprecations in those files.

- 16ffdd6: Remove direct `vite` dependency
- 8069f4a: Update Scaffolder module template to add itself to the backend
- 97422b0: Update templates to not refer to backend-common
- 0e1a817: The app build process now outputs an additional `index.html.tmpl` file. This is an non-templated version of the `index.html` file, which can be used to delay templating until runtime.

  The new `index.html.tmpl` file also sets a `backstage-public-path` meta tag to be templated at runtime. The meta tag is in turn picked up by the new `@backstage/cli/config/webpack-public-path.js` entry point script, which uses it to set the runtime public path of the Webpack bundle.

- 1b5c264: Add `checks: 'read'` for default GitHub app permissions
- b4685e7: Added `watchOptions` to frontend webpack config for compatibility with Yarn PnP
- d29fc1b: Updated dependency `@module-federation/enhanced` to `^0.6.0`.
- f865103: Updated dependency `esbuild` to `^0.23.0`.
- ab7713a: Updated dependency `eslint-plugin-jest` to `^28.0.0`.
- c78ff91: Updated dependency `@rollup/plugin-commonjs` to `^26.0.0`.
- 4ebf36f: Upgrade to `vite@v5`
- 2d3caaf: The build commands now support the new `backstage.inline` flag in `package.json`, which causes the contents of private packages to be inlined into the consuming package, rather than be treated as an external dependency.
- 569c3f0: Fixed an issue where published frontend packages would end up with an invalid import structure if a single module imported both `.css` and `.svg` files.
- 3d88455: Add support for `backstage:^` version ranges to versions:bump when using the experimental yarn plugin
- d10f6b6: Allow overriding minify flag with build repo command

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 32a38e1: **BREAKING**: The lockfile (`yarn.lock`) dependency analysis and mutations have been removed from several commands.

  The `versions:bump` command will no longer attempt to bump and deduplicate dependencies by modifying the lockfile, it will only update `package.json` files.

  The `versions:check` command has been removed, since its only purpose was verification and mutation of the lockfile. We recommend using the `yarn dedupe` command instead, or the `yarn-deduplicate` package if you're using Yarn classic.

  The check that was built into the `package start` command has been removed, it will no longer warn about lockfile mismatches.

  The packages in the Backstage ecosystem handle package duplications much better now than when these CLI features were first introduced, so the need for these features has diminished. By removing them, we drastically reduce the integration between the Backstage CLI and Yarn, making it much easier to add support for other package managers in the future.

### Patch Changes

- 7eb08a6: Add frontend-dynamic-container role to eslint config factory
- b2d97fd: Fixing loading of additional config files with new `ConfigSources`
- fbc7819: Use ES2022 in CLI bundler

- 6d898d8: Switched the `process` polyfill to use `require.resolve` for greater compatability.
- e53074f: Updated default backend plugin to use `RootConfigService` instead of `Config`. This also removes the dependency on `@backstage/config` as it's no longer used.
- ee2b0e5: The experimental module federation build now has the ability to force the use of development versions of `react` and `react-dom` by setting the `FORCE_REACT_DEVELOPMENT` flag.
- 239dffc: Remove usage of deprecated functionality from @backstage/config-loader
- e6e7d86: Switched the target from `'ES2022'` to `'es2022'` for better compatibility with older versions of `swc`.
- 2ced236: Updated dependency `@module-federation/enhanced` to `0.3.1`
- 0eedec3: Add support for dynamic plugins via the EXPERIMENTAL_MODULE_FEDERATION environment variable when running `yarn start`.

## 0.26.11

### Patch Changes

- 133464c: Added experimental support for dynamic frontend plugin builds, enabled via setting `EXPERIMENTAL_MODULE_FEDERATION` for the app build, and using the `frontend-dynamic-container` package role to create a container. Both of these are experimental and will change in the future.
- e2e320c: - remove unused dependencies `winston` and `yn` from the template of backend plugins;
  - update `msw` to version `2.3.1` in the template of backend plugins;
    starting with v1 and switching later to v2 is tedious and not straight forward; it's easier to start with v2;
- 0540c5a: Updated the scaffolding output message for `plugin-common` in `backstage-cli`. Now, when executing `backstage-cli new` to create a new `plugin-common` package, the output message accurately reflects the action by displaying `Creating common plugin package...` instead of the previous, less accurate `Creating backend plugin...`.
- 7652db4: Only bootstrap global-agent if it's actually being used
- f0c0039: Fix issue with CLI that was preventing upgrading from 1.28
- d228862: Update default backend plugin created by the cli to use non-deprecated error handling middleware
- da90cce: Updated dependency `esbuild` to `^0.21.0`.
- a60d73b: Fix a few minor issues with the backend template that were causing failing linting checks in the main repo.
- 0510d98: Subpath export `package.json` should be of a unique name to avoid typescript resolution issues
- 4baac0c: The `backendPlugin` and `backendModule` factory now includes a step for automatically adding the new backend plugin/module to the `index.ts` file of the backend.

## 0.26.5

### Patch Changes

- b8f1fc2: The `build-workspace` command no longer manually runs `yarn postpack`, relying instead on the fact that running `yarn pack` will automatically invoke the `postpack` script. No action is necessary if you are running the latest version of yarn 1, 3, or 4.
- fcd3462: Both the target and types library have been bumped from ES2021 to ES2022 in `@backstage/cli/config/tsconfig.json`.
- 0cc5ed3: Add support for `versions:migrate` to do code changes. Can be skipped with `--no-code-changes`
- f97ad04: Add preserveModules to rollup, which allows better async loading and tree-shaking in webpack
- 2a6f10d: The `versions:bump` command will no longer exit with a non-zero status if the version bump fails due to forbidden duplicate package installations. It will now also provide more information about how to troubleshoot such an error. The set of forbidden duplicates has also been expanded to include all `@backstage/*-app-api` packages.
- c5d7b40: Allow passing a `--require` argument through to the Node process during `package start`
- cc3c518: Fixed an issue causing the `repo fix` command to set an incorrect `workspace` property using Windows
- 812dff0: Add previously-missing semicolon in file templated by `backstage-cli new --select plugin`.
- f185603: Fixed the dynamic import of vite.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/catalog-model@1.5.0
  - @backstage/eslint-plugin@0.1.8
  - @backstage/integration@1.11.0

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d72065: The backend devlopment server transpilation has been replaced with a simplified solution based on SWC, which is already the transpiler used for tests.

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- 8db5c3cd7a: Removed support for the `publishConfig.alphaTypes` and `.betaTypes` fields that were used together with `--experimental-type-build` to generate `/alpha` and `/beta` entry points. Use the `exports` field to achieve this instead.
- 4e36abef14: Remove support for the deprecated `--experimental-type-build` option for `package build`.

### Patch Changes

- 4ba4ac351f: Switch from using deprecated `@esbuild-kit/*` packages to using `tsx`. This also switches to using the new module loader `register` API when available, avoiding the experimental warning when starting backends.
- cd80ebb062: Updated dependency `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` to `^0.16.0`.

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- 8defbd5434: Update typescript-eslint to 6.7.x, adding compatibility with TypeScript 5.2.

  This includes a major update on typescript-eslint, you can see the details in the [release notes](https://typescript-eslint.io/blog/announcing-typescript-eslint-v6/).

- 7077dbf131: **BREAKING** The new backend start command that used to be enabled by setting `EXPERIMENTAL_BACKEND_START` is now the default. To revert to the old behavior set `LEGACY_BACKEND_START`, which is recommended if you haven't migrated to the new backend system.

  This new command is no longer based on Webpack, but instead uses Node.js loaders to transpile on the fly. Rather than hot reloading modules the entire backend is now restarted on change, but the SQLite database state is still maintained across restarts via a parent process.

### Patch Changes

- 9468a67b92: In frontend builds and tests `process.env.HAS_REACT_DOM_CLIENT` will now be defined if `react-dom/client` is present, i.e. if using React 18. This allows for conditional imports of `react-dom/client`.
- 68158034e8: Fix for the new backend `start` command to make it work on Windows.
- 4f16e60e6d: Request slightly smaller pages of data from GitHub
- 21cd3b1b24: Added a template for creating `node-library` packages with `yarn new`.
- d0f26cfa4f: Fixed an issue where the new backend start command would not gracefully shut down the backend process on Windows.
- 1ea20b0be5: Updated dependency `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` to `6.7.5`.
- 2ef6522552: Support for the `.icon.svg` extension has been deprecated and will be removed in the future. The implementation of this extension is too tied to a particular version of MUI and the SVGO, and it makes it harder to evolve the build system. We may introduce the ability to reintroduce this kind of functionality in the future through configuration for use in internal plugins, but for now we're forced to remove it.

  To migrate existing code, rename the `.icon.svg` file to `.tsx` and replace the `<svg>` element with `<SvgIcon>` from MUI and add necessary imports. For example:

  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';
  import SvgIcon from '@material-ui/core/SvgIcon';
  import { IconComponent } from '@backstage/core-plugin-api';

  export const CodeSceneIcon = (props: SvgIconProps) => (
    <SvgIcon {...props}>
      <g>
        <path d="..." />
      </g>
    </SvgIcon>
  );
  ```

- b9ec93430e: The scaffolder-module template now recommends usage of `createMockDirectory` instead of `mock-fs`.
- de42eebaaf: Bumped dev dependencies `@types/node` and `mock-fs`.
- 425203f898: Fixed recursive reloading issues of the backend, caused by unwanted watched files.
- 3ef18f8c06: Explicitly set `exports: 'named'` for CJS builds, ensuring that they have e.g. `exports["default"] = catalogPlugin;`
- 7187f2953e: The experimental package discovery will now always use the package name for include and exclude filtering, rather than the full module id. Entries pointing to a subpath export will now instead have an `export` field specifying the subpath that the import is from.

## 0.22.13

### Patch Changes

- 04eabd21bee4: Added the ability to specify the listen address for the `--inspect` and `--inspect-brk` command. You can now set the `ip` and port of the `inspect` and `inspectBrk` by adding for example `--inspect=0.0.0.0:9229`
- 278d9326eb40: Added the ability to create a plain backend module with the `new` command.
- 4d5eeec52d80: Add ESM loader for the experimental backend start command.
- 3494c502aba7: Added a new `repo fix` command that fixes auto-fixable problems in all packages. Initially the command fixes package export declarations, as well as marks all non-bundled frontend packages as side-effect free. Marking packages as free of side-effects can drastically reduce the Webpack bundle size.
- f36113ca2305: Add experimental support for frontend package discovery.
- a23fce763c6a: Fixed a bug where package exports entry points could not be `.tsx` files.
- 8cec7664e146: Removed `@types/node` dependency
- ea779492ad88: Updated dependency `run-script-webpack-plugin` to `^0.2.0`.
- 4af4defcc114: When running `version:bump` it will now log duplicates instead of throwing an error
- 71d4368ae5cc: Added support for the `dev/index` entry point for backend plugins and modules.
- 956d226eeeee: Add `"sideEffects": false` to `package.json` in frontend package templates. This can be added to existing packages using the new `yarn fix` command.
- cd7331587eb3: Removed the experimental `package fix` command that was used to automatically add dependencies to `package.json`, but has since been replaced by the `no-undeclared-imports` rule from `@backstage/eslint-plugin`.

- 314493fa32a0: Introduced the `--alwaysYarnPack` flag on `backstage-cli build-workspace`, which can be passed in cases where accuracy of workspace contents is more important than the

## 0.22.2

### Patch Changes

- 561df21ea3: The `backstage-cli repo test` command now sets a default Jest `--workerIdleMemoryLimit` of 1GB. If needed to ensure that tests are not run in band, `--maxWorkers=2` is set as well. This is the recommended workaround for dealing with Jest workers leaking memory and eventually hitting the heap limit.
- 2815981057: Show module name causing error during build
- dd8a9afe66: Replaced several monorepo lint rules with new rules from `@backstage/eslint-plugin`. See the [README](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin/README.md) for a full list of rules.
- a9c50af76b: Fixed Webpack loader patterns so that they properly match the file suffix only.

- 6d3abfded1: Switch to inline source maps for test transpilation, simplifying editor setups.

### Patch Changes

- db2e137744: Removed unnecessary usage of `ThemeProvider` from the `ExampleComponent` test in the plugin template.
- 47c10706df: Fixed an issue where the CLI would fail to function when there was a mix of workspace and non-workspace versions of the same package in `yarn.lock` when using Yarn 3.

- 4b572126f1: Add experimental environment variable to enable caching for production builds.

- 7c8a974515: The `repo test`, `repo lint`, and `repo build` commands will now analyze `yarn.lock` for dependency changes when searching for changed packages. This allows you to use the `--since <ref>` flag even if you have `yarn.lock` changes.
- e1b71e142e: Workspace ranges are no longer considered invalid by version commands.

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 736f893f72: The Jest configuration that was previously enabled with `BACKSTAGE_NEXT_TESTS` is now enabled by default. To revert to the old configuration you can now instead set `BACKSTAGE_OLD_TESTS`.

  This new configuration uses the `babel` coverage provider rather than `v8`. It used to be that `v8` worked better when using Sucrase for transpilation, but now that we have switched to SWC, `babel` seems to work better. In addition, the new configuration also enables source maps by default, as they no longer have a negative impact on code coverage accuracy, and it also enables a modified Jest runtime with additional caching of script objects.

### Patch Changes

- 91d050c140: changed tests created by create-plugin to follow eslint-rules best practices particularly testing-library/prefer-screen-queries and testing-library/render-result-naming-convention

- 459a3457e1: Bump `msw` version in default plugin/app templates
- c27eabef6b: Adds new web-library package option when generating a new plugin
- 8fffe42708: JSX and React Fast Refresh transforms are no longer enabled when bundling backend code.
- 309f2daca4: Updated dependency `esbuild` to `^0.16.0`.

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 7539b36748: Added a new ESLint rule that restricts imports of Link from @material-ui

  The rule can be can be overridden in the following way:

  ```diff
  module.exports = require('@backstage/cli/config/eslint-factory')(__dirname, {
  +  restrictedImports: [
  +    { name: '@material-ui/core', importNames: [] },
  +    { name: '@material-ui/core/Link', importNames: [] },
  +  ],
  });
  ```

- 384eaa2307: Switched `tsconfig.json` to target and support `ES2021`, in line with the bump to Node.js 16 & 18.

### Patch Changes

- e52d6ad861: Updated the `backstage-cli` so that the `list-deprecations` command is visible and also removed the "[EXPERIMENTAL]" tag.
- 88f99b8b13: Bumped `tar` dependency to `^6.1.12` in order to ensure Node.js v18 compatibility.
- df21bbd4ad: Removed googleAnalyticsTrackingId configSchema.
- 286d474675: Minor update to the `index.html` template that updates the comment at the end to be more accurate.
- 4c16213e7d: The built-in Jest configuration now always uses the Jest environments that are bundled with the CLI by default. This avoids a situation where Jest potentially picks up an incompatible version of the environment package from a different dependency in the project.

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- f368ad7279: **BREAKING**: Bumped `jest`, `jest-runtime`, and `jest-environment-jsdom` to v29. This is up from v27, so check out both the [v28](https://jestjs.io/docs/28.x/upgrading-to-jest28) and [v29](https://jestjs.io/docs/upgrading-to-jest29) (later [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/29.x/upgrading-to-jest29)) migration guides.

  Particular changes that where encountered in the main Backstage repo are:

  - The updated snapshot format.
  - `jest.useFakeTimers('legacy')` is now `jest.useFakeTimers({ legacyFakeTimers: true })`.
  - Error objects collected by `withLogCollector` from `@backstage/test-utils` are now objects with a `detail` property rather than a string.

### Patch Changes

- 78d5eb299e: Tweak the Jest Caching loader to only operate when in `watch` mode
- 9c595302cb: Normalize on winston version ^3.2.1
- 24b40140c4: Treat files in `__testUtils__` and `__mocks__` directories as test files for linting
  purposes.

  Updates the parts of the eslint configuration generator that specify which files
  should be treated as test code to include any files under two additional
  directories:

  - `__mocks__`: this is the directory used by Jest[0] for mock code.
  - `__testUtils__`: a suggested location for utility code executed only when
    running tests.

- 3e309107ca: Updated fallback versions of dependencies in all templates.
- 292a088807: Added a new `repo test` command.

- 2d3a5f09ab: Use `response.json` rather than `response.send` where appropriate, as outlined in `SECURITY.md`
- 2dddb32fea: Switched the Jest transform for YAML files to use a custom one available at `@backstage/cli/config/jestYamlTransform.js`.
- a541a3a78a: Switch to upfront resolution of `swc-loader` in Webpack config.
- cfb3598410: Removed `tsx` and `jsx` as supported extensions in backend packages. For most
  repos, this will not have any effect. But if you inadvertently had added some
  `tsx`/`jsx` files to your backend package, you may now start to see `code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND'` errors when launching the backend locally. The reason for
  this is that the offending files get ignored during transpilation. Hence, the
  importing file can no longer find anything to import.

  The fix is to rename any `.tsx` files in your backend packages to `.ts` instead,
  or `.jsx` to `.js`.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 1fe6823bb5: Updated dependency `eslint-plugin-jest` to `^27.0.0`.

  Note that this major update to the Jest plugin contains some breaking changes.
  This means that some of your tests may start seeing some new lint errors. [Read about them here](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#2700-2022-08-28).

  These are mostly possible to fix automatically. You can try to run `yarn backstage-cli repo lint --fix` in your repo root to have most or all of them
  corrected.

### Patch Changes

- 8d886dd33e: The `create-plugin` and `create` commands have both been deprecated in favor of a new `new` command. The `new` command is functionally identical to `create`, but the new naming makes it possible to use as yarn script, since `yarn create` is reserved.
- cc63eb8611: Sort entries in skeleton.tar.gz for better docker layer caching
- 548053614a: Deprecated the `plugin:diff` command. If you wish to keep running similar checks in your project we recommend using bespoke scripts. A useful utility for such scripts is `@manypkg/get-packages`, which helps you enumerate all packages in a monorepo.
- 513b4dd4ef: The `versions:bump` command will now update dependency ranges in `package.json`, even if the new version is within the current range.
- 221e951298: Added support for custom certificate for webpack dev server.
- 934cc34563: Avoid validating the backend configuration schema when loading static configuration for building the frontend.
- 3d4f5daadf: Remove use of deprecated trimLeft/trimRight
- 817f3196f6: Added a new `migrate react-router-deps` command to aid in the migration to React Router v6 stable.
- 742cb4f3d7: Fix issue when using `.jsx` files inside tests
- e7600bdb04: Tweaked workspace packaging to not rewrite existing `package.json` files.
- 6ae0f6a719: Switch out `sucrase` for `swc` for transpilation.

  `sucrase` is a little more relaxed when it comes to supporting the ways of mocking in `jest`. You might have to make some changes to your tests to meet the `jest` standard and spec if your tests seems to start failing.

  Mocks that look like this are invalid, and they will throw a reference error in line with the `jest` documentation [here on example 3](https://jestjs.io/docs/es6-class-mocks#calling-jestmock-with-the-module-factory-parameter)

  ```ts
  const mockCommandExists = jest.fn();
  jest.mock('command-exists', () => mockCommandExists);
  ```

  You might need to update these mocks to look a little like the following to defer the call to the `jest.fn()` spy until the mock is called.

  ```ts
  const mockCommandExists = jest.fn();
  jest.mock(
    'command-exists',
    () =>
      (...args: any[]) =>
        commandExists(...args),
  );
  ```

  Also, imports are immutable. So it means that you might get some errors when trying to use `jest.spyOn` with starred imports. You might see an error like this:

  ```log
  TypeError: Cannot redefine property: executeFrameHandlerStrategy
          at Function.defineProperty (<anonymous>)

        20 | import { AuthResolverContext } from '../types';
        21 |
      > 22 | const mockFrameHandler = jest.spyOn(
           |                               ^
        23 |   helpers,
        24 |   'executeFrameHandlerStrategy',
        25 | ) as unknown as jest.MockedFunction<
  ```

  This happens when you try to do `import * as something from './something'` and then `jest.spyOn(something, 'test)`. You will need to add a `jest.mock` call to mock out the required starred import to return `jest.fn()` functions from the start. Something like this fixes the above test:

  ```ts
  jest.mock('../../helpers', () => ({
    executeFrameHandlerStrategy: jest.fn(),
  }));
  ```

  You can also remove any occurrence of `hot(App)` and any import of `react-hot-loader` if you're using the that package locally, as all this has now been replaced with [React Refresh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-refresh) which you will get out of the box with the new CLI.

  **Note** If you're experiencing difficulties with running tests after the migration, please reach out to us on Discord to see if we can help, or raise an issue. But in the meantime you can switch back to the existing behaviour by using the following config in your root `package.json`.

  ```json
  "jest": {
    "transform": {
      "\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx|mjs|cjs)$": "@backstage/cli/config/jestSucraseTransform.js",
      "\\.(bmp|gif|jpg|jpeg|png|frag|xml|svg|eot|woff|woff2|ttf)$": "@backstage/cli/config/jestFileTransform.js",
      "\\.(yaml)$": "jest-transform-yaml"
    }
  }
  ```

- 1cb078ad9f: Fixed a misconfiguration where all modules where treated as ESM by the React Refresh plugin for Webpack.
- 1fd4f2746f: Removed internal dependencies on Lerna. It is now no longer necessary to have Lerna installed in a project to use all features of the Backstage CLI.

- 68c2697077: Added a new `backstage-cli repo clean` command that cleans the repo root and runs the clean script in all packages.
- 7d47def9c4: Added dependency on `@types/jest` v27. The `@types/jest` dependency has also been removed from the plugin template and should be removed from any of your own internal packages. If you wish to override the version of `@types/jest` or `jest`, use Yarn resolutions.
- a7e82c9b01: Updated `versions:bump` command to be compatible with Yarn 3.

## 0.18.1

### Patch Changes

- d45bbfeb69: Linting is now ignored for any `.eslintrc.*` files, not just `.eslintrc.js`.
- 72c228fdb8: Fixed a bug where `NODE_ENV` was not set in the environment when starting the backend in development mode. It has always been the case that Webpack transformed `NODE_ENV` when running in development mode, but this did not affect dependencies in `node_modules` as they are treated as external.
- a539564c0d: Added Backstage version to output of `yarn backstage-cli info` command
- fd68d6f138: Added resolution of `.json` and `.wasm` files to the Webpack configuration in order to match defaults.

  - `plugin:build` - Use `package build` instead
  - `plugin:serve` - Use `package start` instead
  - `build` - Use `package build` instead
  - `lint` - Use `package lint` instead
  - `prepack` - Use `package prepack` instead
  - `postpack` - Use `package postpack` instead

  In order to replace these you need to have [migrated to using package roles](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/package-role-migration).

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f7d4763ab: **BREAKING**: Bump the version range of `jest` from `^26.0.1` to `^27.5.1`. You can find the complete list of breaking changes [here](https://github.com/facebook/jest/releases/tag/v27.0.0).

  We strongly recommend to have completed the [package role migration](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/package-role-migration) before upgrading to this version, as the package roles are used to automatically determine the testing environment for each package. If you instead want to set an explicit test environment for each package, you can do so for example in the `"jest"` section in `package.json`. The default test environment for all packages is now `node`, which is also the new Jest default.

  Note that one of the breaking changes of Jest 27 is that the `jsdom` environment no longer includes `setImmediate` and `clearImmediate`, which means you might need to update some of your frontend packages. Another notable change is that `jest.useFakeTimers` now defaults to the `'modern'` implementation, which also mocks microtasks.

### Patch Changes

- e80ecad93c: Bump the `rushstack` api generator libraries to their latest versions
- c54ce828bd: build(deps): bump `eslint-plugin-jest` from 25.3.4 to 26.1.2
- f151dfee5a: build(deps): bump `eslint-webpack-plugin` from 2.6.0 to 3.1.1

- 3c26b2edb5: build(deps): bump `npm-packlist` from 3.0.0 to 5.0.0
- ed3551b7be: Introduced a new experimental test configuration with a number of changes. It switches the coverage provider from `v8` to the default Babel provider, along with always enabling source maps in the Sucrase transform. It also adds a custom module loader that caches both file transforms and VM script objects across all projects in a test run, which provides a big performance boost when running tests from the project root, increasing speed and reducing memory usage.

  This new configuration is not enabled by default. It is enabled by setting the environment variable `BACKSTAGE_NEXT_TESTS` to a non-empty value.

- 6ad0c45648: Added an experimental `package fix` command which applies automated fixes to the target package. The initial fix that is available is to add missing monorepo dependencies to the target package.
- 5b3079694e: Stop logging "Stopped watcher" when shutting down the development backend.
- f512554910: Updated the plugin template to install version 14 of `@testing-library/user-event`.

  To apply this change to your own project, update the `devDependencies` section in your `package.json` files:

  ```diff
   "devDependencies": {
     ... omitted dev dependencies ...
  -   "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.1.8",
  +   "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.0.0",
      ... omitted dev dependencies ...
   }
  ```

- df7862cfa6: Fixed a bug were the `react-hot-loader` transform was being applied to backend development builds.

- c47509e1a0: Implemented changes suggested by Deepsource.io including multiple double non-null assertion operators and unexpected awaits for non-promise values.
- 948a56f401: Added a new experimental `repo list-deprecations` command, which scans the entire project for usage of deprecated APIs.
- 4782f9e925: Fixed misleading log message during frontend plugin creation.
- 0383cd0228: The `versions:*` commands no longer warns about duplicate plugin libraries, such as `@backstage/plugin-catalog-common`.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@1.1.0

## 0.17.0-next.3

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@1.0.1-next.0

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 217547ae51: **BREAKING**: The provided Jest configuration now only matches files with a `.test.` infix, rather than any files that is suffixed with `test.<ext>`. In particular this means that files named just `test.ts` will no longer be considered a test file.

### Patch Changes

- 947ae3b40e: Applied the fix from version `0.15.3` of this package, which is part of the `v0.71.1` release of Backstage.
- 19eed0edd9: Fix for `overrides` not being properly forwarded from the extra configuration passed to `@backstage/cli/config/eslint-factory`.

## 0.15.3

### Patch Changes

- Fixed an issue where the CLI would try and fail to require the `package.json` of other Backstage packages, like `@backstage/dev-utils/package.json`.

## 0.15.2

### Patch Changes

- 2c528506aa: Added `--since <ref>` flag for `repo build` command.`
- 60799cc5be: build(deps-dev): bump `@types/npm-packlist` from 1.1.2 to 3.0.0
- d3d1b82198: chore(deps): bump `minimatch` from 5.0.0 to 5.0.1
- e0a69ba49f: build(deps): bump `fs-extra` from 9.1.0 to 10.0.1
- 44cc7c3b95: Added a new ESLint configuration setup for packages, which utilizes package roles to generate the correct configuration. The new configuration is available at `@backstage/cli/config/eslint-factory`.

  Introduced a new `backstage-cli migrate package-lint-configs` command, which migrates old lint configurations to use `@backstage/cli/config/eslint-factory`.

- b1aacbf96a: Applied the fix from version `0.15.1` of this package, which was part of the `v0.70.1` release of Backstage.
- d2ecde959b: Package roles are now marked as stable and migration is encouraged. Please check out the [migration guide](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/package-role-migration).

  The new `package`, `repo`, and `migrate` command categories are now marked as stable.

  Marked all commands that are being replaced by the new `package` and `repo` commands as deprecated.

  The package templates used by the `create` command have all been updated to use package roles.

- f06da37290: The backend development setup now ignores the `"browser"` and `"module"` entry points in `package.json`, and instead always uses `"main"`.
- 6a1fe077ad: Changed the logic for how modules are marked as external in the Rollup build of packages. Rather than only marking dependencies and build-in Node.js modules as external, all non-relative imports are now considered external.
- dc6002a7b9: The `--since` flag of repo commands now silently falls back to using the provided `ref` directly if no merge base is available.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.9.7

## 0.15.2-next.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.9.7-next.0

## 0.15.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixed an issue where the release stage entry point of packages were not resolved correctly.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 8c3f30cb28: **BREAKING**: Removed the deprecated `app.<key>` template variables from the `index.html` templating. These should be replaced by using `config.getString("app.<key>")` instead.

### Patch Changes

- 46a19c599f: The CLI now bundles both version 16 and 17 of the patched `@hot-loader/react-dom` dependency, and selects the appropriate one based on what version of `react-dom` is installed within the app.

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- 5cc7f48400: Fixed a bug in the built-in Jest configuration that prevented it from identifying packages that had migrated to using the new package scripts to run tests.
- 49ae6c9573: chore(deps-dev): bump `@types/rollup-plugin-postcss` from 2.0.1 to 3.1.4
- d64b8d3678: chore(deps): bump `minimatch` from 3.0.4 to 5.0.0
- d2e9d2a34f: chore(deps): bump `@hot-loader/react-dom` from 16.13.0 to 17.0.2
- c2f3a548cf: Fix building of backends with `repo build --all`, where it would previously only work if the build was executed within the backend package.
- 3d7ed5377a: Ignore setupTests and the file inside ./dev folder recursively. Eslint
  can not resolve relative paths as we defined in the rule import/no-extraneous-dependencies, and it does not apply this rule.

  A downside to use a recursive definition would be to checking all `dev` folders, which might not be wanted. Ensure you don't use
  the `dev` folder out of scope (must be used for dev. env. only)

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.9.6

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 1fc0cd3896: Bumped Webpack and Rollup `svgr` dependencies and updated the AST template for `.icon.svg` modules. This means that SVG icon imports are now using SVGO v2.

### Patch Changes

- 0b74c72987: Added a new experimental and hidden `backstage-cli repo lint` command that can be used to lint all packages in the project, similar to `lerna run lint`.
- 532dae9c4c: The `versions:bump --release next` command is updated to compare the `main` and `next` release manifests and prefer the latest.
- 1ed305728b: Bump `node-fetch` to version 2.6.7 and `cross-fetch` to version 3.1.5
- c77c5c7eb6: Added `backstage.role` to `package.json`
- 22862486de: The `versions:bump` command now filters out `npm_` environment configuration when running `yarn install`. This has the effect of allowing it to consider local configuration files within the repository, which is the behavior that one would expect.
- 22862486de: The `versions:bump` command now also considers the root `package.json` when searching for updates. It has also received updates to its output, including a link the [Backstage upgrade helper](https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper) and silenced `yarn install` output.
- 7410e12268: Several changes were made to the new experimental package roles system. Unless you have been experimenting with using this new system, these changes have no affect on your project.

  Renamed the `backstage-cli migrate package-role` command to `backstage-cli migrate package-roles`.

  Updated the package role definitions by renaming `app` to `frontend`, `plugin-frontend` to `frontend-plugin`, `plugin-frontend-module` to `frontend-plugin-module`, `plugin-backend` to `backend-plugin`, and `plugin-backend-module` to `backend-plugin-module`

  The `backstage-cli migrate package-scripts` received several tweaks to make it more accurate. It now tries to maintain existing script arguments, like `--config` parameters for `build` and `start` scripts.

  The `script` command category has been renamed to `package`.

  The `backstage-cli package build` command set an incorrect target directory for `app` and `backend` packages, which has been fixed.

  The `backend:bundle` and `repo build` command for the `backend` role was previously ignoring building of bundled packages that had migrated to use package roles and the standard build script, this has now been fixed.

- c6bbafb516: Updated the default [sucrase](https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase)-based Jest transform to include source maps if the environment variable `ENABLE_SOURCE_MAPS` is non-empty. This can be used to better support editor test debugging integrations.
- 7410e12268: The `test` command now automatically adds `--passWithNoTests` to the Jest invocation. To revert this behavior, pass `--passWithNoTests=false` or `--no-passWithNoTests`.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.9.4
  - @backstage/errors@0.2.1
  - @backstage/release-manifests@0.0.2
  - @backstage/cli-common@0.1.7
  - @backstage/config@0.1.14
  - @backstage/types@0.1.2

## 0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- bbbaa8ed61: The `plugin:diff` command no longer validates the existence of any of the files within `dev/` or `src/`.
- eaf67f0578: Introduced initial support for an experimental `backstage.role` field in package.json, as well as experimental and hidden `migrate` and `script` sub-commands. We do not recommend usage of any of these additions yet.
- aeb5c69abb: Introduces a new `--release` parameter to the `backstage-cli versions:bump` command.
  The release can be either a specific version, for example `0.99.1`, or the latest `main` or `next` release.
  The default behavior is to bump to the latest `main` release.
- d59b90852a: The experimental types build enabled by `--experimental-type-build` now runs in a separate worker thread.
- 50a19ff8dd: The file path printed by the default lint formatter is now relative to the repository root, rather than the individual package.
- 63181dee79: Tweaked frontend bundling configuration to avoid leaking declarations into global scope.
- fae2aee878: Removed the `import/no-duplicates` lint rule from the frontend and backend ESLint configurations. This rule is quite expensive to execute and only provides a purely cosmetic benefit, so we opted to remove it from the set of default rules. If you would like to keep this rule you can add it back in your local ESLint configuration:

  ```js
    'import/no-duplicates': 'warn'
  ```

- b906f98119: Rather than calling `yarn pack`, the `build-workspace` and `backend-bundle` commands now move files directly whenever possible. This cuts out several `yarn` invocations and speeds the packing process up by several orders of magnitude.
- d0c71e2aa4: Switched the `lint` command to invoke ESLint directly through its Node.js API rather than spawning a new process.
- d59b90852a: Introduced an experimental and hidden `repo` sub-command, that contains commands that operate on an entire monorepo rather than individual packages.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/release-manifests@0.0.1

- 80f510caee: Log warning if unable to parse yarn.lock

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 1ddf6d9d5a: Removes the previously deprecated `remove-plugin` command alongside the `--lax` option to `app:build`.

### Patch Changes

- c372a5032f: chore(deps): bump `jest-transform-yaml` from 0.1.1 to 1.0.0
- 1b4ab0d44c: Updated the dependency warning that is baked into `app:serve` to only warn about packages that are not allowed to have duplicates.
- dc46efa2cc: Switched the `WebpackDevServer` configuration to use client-side detection of the WebSocket protocol.
- 10086f5873: Upgraded `webpack`, `webpack-dev-server`,`fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`, `react-dev-utils`, and `react-hot-loader`. Since `ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin` no longer runs ESLint, we now include the `ESLintPlugin` from `eslint-webpack-plugin` if the `--check` flag is passed.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 08fa6a604a: Removed the `typescript` dependency from the Backstage CLI in order to decouple the TypeScript version in Backstage projects. To keep using a specific TypeScript version, be sure to add an explicit dependency in your root `package.json`:

  ```json
    "dependencies": {
      ...
      "typescript": "~4.5.4",
    }
  ```

  We recommend using a `~` version range since TypeScript releases do not adhere to semver.

  It may be the case that you end up with errors if you upgrade the TypeScript version. This is because there was a change to TypeScript not long ago that defaulted the type of errors caught in `catch` blocks to `unknown`. You can work around this by adding `"useUnknownInCatchVariables": false` to the `"compilerOptions"` in your `tsconfig.json`:

  ```json
    "compilerOptions": {
      ...
      "useUnknownInCatchVariables": false
    }
  ```

  Another option is to use the utilities from `@backstage/errors` to assert the type of errors caught in `catch` blocks:

  ```ts
  import { assertError, isError } from '@backstage/errors';

  try {
    ...
  } catch (error) {
    assertError(error);
    ...
    // OR
    if (isError(error)) {
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

  Yet another issue you might run into when upgrading TypeScript is incompatibilities in the types from `react-use`. The error you would run into looks something like this:

  ```plain
  node_modules/react-use/lib/usePermission.d.ts:1:54 - error TS2304: Cannot find name 'DevicePermissionDescriptor'.

  1 declare type PermissionDesc = PermissionDescriptor | DevicePermissionDescriptor | MidiPermissionDescriptor | PushPermissionDescriptor;
  ```

  If you encounter this error, the simplest fix is to replace full imports of `react-use` with more specific ones. For example, the following:

  ```ts
  import { useAsync } from 'react-use';
  ```

  Would be converted into this:

  ```ts
  import useAsync from 'react-use/lib/useAsync';
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 6e34e2cfbf: Introduce `--deprecated` option to `config:check` to log all deprecated app configuration properties

  ```sh
  $ yarn backstage-cli config:check --lax --deprecated
  config:check --lax --deprecated
  Loaded config from app-config.yaml
  The configuration key 'catalog.processors.githubOrg' of app-config.yaml is deprecated and may be removed soon. Configure a GitHub integration instead.
  ```

- f2fe4d240b: Switched to only apply `@hot-loader/react-dom` [Webpack aliasing](https://github.com/hot-loader/react-dom/tree/master/source#webpack) when using React 16.
- 2a42d573d2: Introduced a new `--experimental-type-build` option to the various package build commands. This option switches the type definition build to be executed using API Extractor rather than a `rollup` plugin. In order for this experimental switch to work, you must also have `@microsoft/api-extractor` installed within your project, as it is an optional peer dependency.

  The biggest difference between the existing mode and the experimental one is that rather than just building a single `dist/index.d.ts` file, API Extractor will output `index.d.ts`, `index.beta.d.ts`, and `index.alpha.d.ts`, all in the `dist` directory. Each of these files will have exports from more unstable release stages stripped, meaning that `index.d.ts` will omit all exports marked with `@alpha` or `@beta`, while `index.beta.d.ts` will omit all exports marked with `@alpha`.

  In addition, the `prepack` command now has support for `alphaTypes` and `betaTypes` fields in the `publishConfig` of `package.json`. These optional fields can be pointed to `dist/types.alpha.d.ts` and `dist/types.beta.d.ts` respectively, which will cause `<name>/alpha` and `<name>/beta` entry points to be generated for the package. See the [`@backstage/catalog-model`](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/catalog-model/package.json) package for an example of how this can be used in practice.

## 0.10.3

### Patch Changes

- dfc1110dc4: Added peerPluginDependencies option to experimentalInstallationRecipe for install command to install plugins it depends on.
- 58b0262dd9: Pruned unused dependencies.
- 5fdc8df0e8: The frontend configuration is now available as a `config` global during templating of the `index.html` file. This allows for much more flexibility as the values available during templating is not longer hardcoded to a fixed set of values.

  For example, to access the app title, you would now do the following:

  ```html
  <title><%= config.getString('app.title') %></title>
  ```

  Along with this change, usage of the existing `app.<key>` values has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The general pattern for migrating existing usage is to replace `<%= app.<key> %>` with `<%= config.getString('app.<key>') %>`, although in some cases you may need to use for example `config.has('app.<key>')` or `config.getOptionalString('app.<key>')` instead.

  The [`@backstage/create-app` changelog](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/create-app/CHANGELOG.md#049) also contains more details how to migrate existing usage.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 0ebb05eee2: Add cli option to minify the generated code of a plugin or backend package

  ```
  backstage-cli plugin:build --minify
  backstage-cli backend:build --minify
  ```

- cd450844f6: Updated the frontend plugin template to put React dependencies in `peerDependencies` by default, as well as allowing both React v16 and v17. This change can be applied to existing plugins by running `yarn backstage-cli plugin:diff` within the plugin package directory.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- ea99ef5198: Remove the `backend:build-image` command from the CLI and added more deprecation warnings to other deprecated fields like `--lax` and `remove-plugin`

### Patch Changes

- e7230ef814: Bump react-dev-utils to v12
- 416b68675d: build(dependencies): bump `style-loader` from 1.2.1 to 3.3.1

  - @backstage/config-loader@0.8.1

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- dde216acf4: Switch the default test coverage provider from the jest default one to `'v8'`, which provides much better coverage information when using the default Backstage test setup. This is considered a bug fix as the current coverage information is often very inaccurate.
- 719cc87d2f: Disable ES transforms in tests transformed by the `jestSucraseTransform.js`. This is not considered a breaking change since all code is already transpiled this way in the development setup.
- bab752e2b3: Change default port of backend from 7000 to 7007.

  This is due to the AirPlay Receiver process occupying port 7000 and preventing local Backstage instances on MacOS to start.

  You can change the port back to 7000 or any other value by providing an `app-config.yaml` with the following values:

  ```
  backend:
    listen: 0.0.0.0:7123
    baseUrl: http://localhost:7123
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 677bfc2dd0: Keep backstage.json in sync

  The `versions:bump` script now takes care about updating the `version` property inside `backstage.json` file. The file is created if is not present.

- 8809b6c0dd: Update the json-schema dependency version.
- fdfd2f8a62: remove double config dep
- 1e99c73c75: Update internal usage of `configLoader.loadConfig` that now returns an object instead of an array of configs.
- 6dcfe227a2: Added a scaffolder backend module template for the `create` command.
- 4ca3542fdd: Fixed a bug where calling `backstage-cli backend:bundle --build-dependencies` with no dependencies to be built would cause all monorepo packages to be built instead.
- 867ea81d15: bump `@rollup/plugin-commonjs` from 17.1.0 to 21.0.1
- 16d06f6ac3: Introduces new `backstage-cli create` command to replace `create-plugin` and make space for creating a wider array of things. The create command also adds a new template for creating isomorphic common plugin packages.

- b393c4d4be: Fixed the `config:check` command that was incorrectly only validating frontend configuration. Also added a `--frontend` flag to the command which maintains that behavior.
- 0611f3b3e2: Reading app config from a remote server
- ec64d9590c: Make `ExitCodeError` call `super` early to avoid compiler warnings

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- b486adb8c6: The Jest configuration that's included with the Backstage CLI has received several changes.

  As a part of migrating to more widespread usage of ESM modules, the default configuration now transforms all source files everywhere, including those within `node_modules`. Due to this change the existing `transformModules` option has been removed and will be ignored. There is also a list of known packages that do not require transforms in the CLI, which will evolve over time. If needed there will also be an option to add packages to this list in the future, but it is not included yet to avoid clutter.

  To counteract the slowdown of the additional transforms that have been introduced, the default configuration has also been reworked to enable caching across different packages. Previously each package in a Backstage monorepo would have its own isolated Jest cache, but it is now shared between packages that have a similar enough Jest configuration.

  Another change that will speed up test execution is that the transformer for `.esm.js` files has been switched. It used to be an ESM transformer based on Babel, but it is also done by sucrase now since it is significantly faster.

  The changes above are not strictly breaking as all tests should still work. It may however cause excessive slowdowns in projects that have configured custom transforms in the `jest` field within `package.json` files. In this case it is either best to consider removing the custom transforms, or overriding the `transformIgnorePatterns` to instead use Jest's default `'/node_modules/'` pattern.

  This change also removes the `@backstage/cli/config/jestEsmTransform.js` transform, which can be replaced by using the `@backstage/cli/config/sucraseEsmTransform.js` transform instead.

### Patch Changes

- 36e67d2f24: Internal updates to apply more strict checks to throw errors.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.7.0
  - @backstage/errors@0.1.3

## 0.7.16

### Patch Changes

- 53bdc66623: add a --from <location> option to the plugin install command
- 84e24fcdaf: Bump sucrase to version 3.20.2
- 6583c6ac40: Add semicolon in template to make prettier happy
- c6f927d819: Bump mini-css-extract-plugin to v2
- 16f044cb6b: Update default backend ESLint configuration to allow usage of `__dirname` in tests.
- 1ef9e64901: Add an experimental `install <plugin>` command.

  Given a `pluginId`, the command looks for NPM packages matching `@backstage/plugin-{pluginId}` or `backstage-plugin-{pluginId}` or `{pluginId}`. It looks for the `experimentalInstallationRecipe` in their `package.json` for the steps of installation. Detailed documentation and API Spec to follow (and to be decided as well).

## 0.7.15

### Patch Changes

- ae4680b88d: The `create-plugin` command now passes the extension name via the `name` key
  in `createRoutableExtension()` calls in newly created plugins.
- df1242ffe4: Adding `--inspect-brk` as an option when debugging backend for development
- c7f2a2307d: When creating a backend plugin with `--backend` flag, don't add `-backend` if it's already suffixed
- 185fec5c0c: The default jest configuration used by the `test` command now supports yarn workspaces. By running `backstage-cli test` in the root of a monorepo, all packages will now automatically be included in the test suite and it will run just like it does within a package. Each package in the monorepo will still use its own local jest configuration, and only packages that have `backstage-cli test` in the `test` script within `package.json` will be included.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.6.10
  - @backstage/cli-common@0.1.4

## 0.7.14

### Patch Changes

- 3a8704f16b: Only serve static assets if there is a public folder during `app:serve` and `plugin:serve`. This fixes a common bug that would break `plugin:serve` with an `EBUSY` error.
- 40199b61d6: Configuration schema is now also collected from the root `package.json` if it exists.
- 2a6c393c06: The `create-plugin` command now prefers dependency versions ranges that are already in the lockfile.
- 58f91943ab: Improved ´plugin:diff´ check for the `package.json` `"files"` field.
- 12e074a6e4: Fix duplication checks to stop looking for the old core packages, and to allow some explicitly
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.6.9

## 0.7.13

### Patch Changes

- c0c51c9710: Disabled ECMAScript transforms in app and backend builds in order to reduce bundle size and runtime performance. For the rationale and a full list of syntax that is no longer transformed, see https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase#transforms. This also enables TypeScripts `useDefineForClassFields` flag by default, which in rare occasions could cause build failures. For instructions on how to mitigate issues due to the flag, see the [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#the-usedefineforclassfields-flag-and-the-declare-property-modifier).

### Patch Changes

- 9d40fcb1e: - Bumping `material-ui/core` version to at least `4.12.2` as they made some breaking changes in later versions which broke `Pagination` of the `Table`.
  - Switching out `material-table` to `@material-table/core` for support for the later versions of `material-ui/core`
  - This causes a minor API change to `@backstage/core-components` as the interface for `Table` re-exports the `prop` from the underlying `Table` components.
  - `onChangeRowsPerPage` has been renamed to `onRowsPerPageChange`
  - `onChangePage` has been renamed to `onPageChange`

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 3108ff7bf: Make `yarn dev` in newly created backend plugins respect the `PLUGIN_PORT` environment variable.

  You can achieve the same in your created backend plugins by making sure to properly call the port and CORS methods on your service builder. Typically in a file named `src/service/standaloneServer.ts` inside your backend plugin package, replace the following:

  ```ts
  const service = createServiceBuilder(module)
    .enableCors({ origin: 'http://localhost:3000' })
    .addRouter('/my-plugin', router);
  ```

  With something like the following:

  ```ts
  let service = createServiceBuilder(module)
    .setPort(options.port)
    .addRouter('/my-plugin', router);
  if (options.enableCors) {
    service = service.enableCors({ origin: 'http://localhost:3000' });
  }
  ```

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.6.4

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 9cd3c533c: Switch from `ts-jest` to `@sucrase/jest-plugin`, improving performance and aligning transpilation with bundling.

  In order to switch back to `ts-jest`, install `ts-jest@^26.4.3` as a dependency in the root of your repo and add the following in the root `package.json`:

  ```json
  "jest": {
    "globals": {
      "ts-jest": {
        "isolatedModules": true
      }
    },
    "transform": {
      "\\.esm\\.js$": "@backstage/cli/config/jestEsmTransform.js",
      "\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$": "ts-jest",
      "\\.(bmp|gif|jpg|jpeg|png|frag|xml|svg)$": "@backstage/cli/config/jestFileTransform.js",
      "\\.(yaml)$": "yaml-jest"
    }
  }
  ```

  Note that this will override the default jest transforms included with the `@backstage/cli`.

  It is possible that some test code needs a small migration as a result of this change, which stems from a difference in how `sucrase` and `ts-jest` transform module re-exports.

  Consider the following code:

  ```ts
  import * as utils from './utils';

  jest.spyOn(utils, 'myUtility').mockReturnValue(3);
  ```

  If the `./utils` import for example refers to an index file that in turn re-exports from `./utils/myUtility`, you would have to change the code to the following to work around the fact that the exported object from `./utils` ends up not having configurable properties, thus breaking `jest.spyOn`.

  ```ts
  import * as utils from './utils/myUtility';

  jest.spyOn(utils, 'myUtility').mockReturnValue(3);
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 7f7443308: Updated dependencies
- 21e8ebef5: Fix error message formatting in the packaging process.

  error.errors can be undefined which will lead to a TypeError, swallowing the actual error message in the process.

  For instance, if you break your tsconfig.json with invalid syntax, backstage-cli will not be able to build anything and it will be very hard to find out why because the underlying error message is hidden behind a TypeError.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 19fe61c27: We have updated the default `eslint` rules in the `@backstage/cli` package.

  ```diff
  -'@typescript-eslint/no-shadow': 'off',
  -'@typescript-eslint/no-redeclare': 'off',
  +'no-shadow': 'off',
  +'no-redeclare': 'off',
  +'@typescript-eslint/no-shadow': 'error',
  +'@typescript-eslint/no-redeclare': 'error',
  ```

  The rules are documented [here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-shadow) and [here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-redeclare).

  This involved a large number of small changes to the code base. When you compile your own code using the CLI, you may also be
  affected. We consider these rules important, and the primary recommendation is to try to update your code according to the
  documentation above. But those that prefer to not enable the rules, or need time to perform the updates, may update their
  local `.eslintrc.js` file(s) in the repo root and/or in individual plugins as they see fit:

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    // ... other declarations
    rules: {
      '@typescript-eslint/no-shadow': 'off',
      '@typescript-eslint/no-redeclare': 'off',
    },
  };
  ```

  Because of the nature of this change, we're unable to provide a grace period for the update :(

### Patch Changes

- 398e1f83e: Update `create-plugin` template to use the new composability API, by switching to exporting a single routable extension component.
- e9aab60c7: Fixed module resolution of external libraries during backend development. Modules used to be resolved relative to the backend entrypoint, but are now resolved relative to each individual module.
- a08c4b0b0: Add check for outdated/duplicate packages to yarn start
- Updated dependencies [062df71db]
- Updated dependencies [e9aab60c7]
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.5.1

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 12a56cdfe: We've bumped the `@eslint-typescript` packages to the latest, which now add some additional rules that might cause lint failures.
  The main one which could become an issue is the [no-use-before-define](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-use-before-define) rule.

  Every plugin and app has the ability to override these rules if you want to ignore them for now.

  You can reset back to the default behaviour by using the following in your own `.eslint.js`

  ```js
  rules: {
    'no-use-before-define': 'off'
  }
  ```

  Because of the nature of this change, we're unable to provide a grace period for the update :(

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1722cb53c: Added support for loading and validating configuration schemas, as well as declaring config visibility through schemas.

  The new `loadConfigSchema` function exported by `@backstage/config-loader` allows for the collection and merging of configuration schemas from all nearby dependencies of the project.

  A configuration schema is declared using the `https://backstage.io/schema/config-v1` JSON Schema meta schema, which is based on draft07. The only difference to the draft07 schema is the custom `visibility` keyword, which is used to indicate whether the given config value should be visible in the frontend or not. The possible values are `frontend`, `backend`, and `secret`, where `backend` is the default. A visibility of `secret` has the same scope at runtime, but it will be treated with more care in certain contexts, and defining both `frontend` and `secret` for the same value in two different schemas will result in an error during schema merging.

  Packages that wish to contribute configuration schema should declare it in a root `"configSchema"` field in `package.json`. The field can either contain an inlined JSON schema, or a relative path to a schema file. Schema files can be in either `.json` or `.d.ts` format.

  TypeScript configuration schema files should export a single `Config` type, for example:

  ```ts
  export interface Config {
    app: {
      /**
       * Frontend root URL
       * @visibility frontend
       */
      baseUrl: string;
    };
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 1722cb53c: Added configuration schema
- 902340451: Support specifying listen host/port for frontend
- Updated dependencies [1722cb53c]
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 28edd7d29: Create backend plugin through CLI
- 1d0aec70f: Upgrade dependency `esbuild@0.7.7`
- 72f6cda35: Adds a new `BACKSTAGE_CLI_BUILD_PARELLEL` environment variable to control
  parallelism for some build steps.

  This is useful in CI to help avoid out of memory issues when using `terser`. The
  `BACKSTAGE_CLI_BUILD_PARELLEL` environment variable can be set to
  `true | false | [integer]` to override the default behaviour. See
  [terser-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin#parallel)
  for more details.

- 8c2b76e45: **BREAKING CHANGE**

  The existing loading of additional config files like `app-config.development.yaml` using APP_ENV or NODE_ENV has been removed.
  Instead, the CLI and backend process now accept one or more `--config` flags to load config files.

  Without passing any flags, `app-config.yaml` and, if it exists, `app-config.local.yaml` will be loaded.
  If passing any `--config <path>` flags, only those files will be loaded, **NOT** the default `app-config.yaml` one.

  The old behaviour of for example `APP_ENV=development` can be replicated using the following flags:

  ```bash
  --config ../../app-config.yaml --config ../../app-config.development.yaml
  ```

- 8afce088a: Use APP_ENV before NODE_ENV for determining what config to load
