   * A display name of the entity, to be presented in user interfaces instead of the `name` property above, when available. This field is sometimes useful when the `name` is cumbersome or ends up being perceived as overly technical. The title generally does not have as stringent format requirements on it, so it may contain special characters and be more explanatory. Do keep it very short though, and avoid situations where a title can be confused with the name of another entity, or where two entities share a title. Note that this is only for display purposes, and may be ignored by some parts of the code. Entity references still always make use of the `name` property, not the title.

If you want to use a different, more human readable string with fewer restrictions on it in user interfaces, see the `title` field below.
