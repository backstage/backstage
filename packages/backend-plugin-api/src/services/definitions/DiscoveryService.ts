/**
 * The DiscoveryService is used to provide a mechanism for backend
 * plugins to discover the endpoints for itself or other backend plugins.
 *
 * See the {@link https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/core-services/discovery | service documentation} for more details.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * The purpose of the discovery API is to allow for many different deployment
 * setups and routing methods through a central configuration, instead
 * of letting each individual plugin manage that configuration.
 *
 * Implementations of the discovery API can be as simple as a URL pattern
 * using the pluginId, but could also have overrides for individual plugins,
 * or query a separate discovery service.

   * @remarks
   *
   * The returned URL should point to an internal endpoint for the plugin, with
   * the shortest route possible. The URL should be used for service-to-service
   * communication within a Backstage backend deployment.
   *
   * This method must always be called just before making each request, as opposed to
   * fetching the URL once when constructing an API client. That is to ensure that more
   * flexible routing patterns can be supported where a different result might be returned each time.
   *
   * For example, asking for the URL for `catalog` may return something
