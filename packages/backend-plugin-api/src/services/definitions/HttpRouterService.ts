   *
   * The paths given follow the same pattern as the routers given to the `use`

   *

   * http.addAuthPolicy({
   *   path: '/static/:id',
   *   allow: 'user-cookie',
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * This allows limited access tokens via cookies on the
   * `/api/<plugin-id>/static/*` paths, but not unauthenticated access.
