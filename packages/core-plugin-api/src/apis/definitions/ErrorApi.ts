 *
 * Plugins can use this API as a method of displaying errors to the user, but also
 * to report errors for collection by error reporting services.
 *
 * If an error can be displayed inline, e.g. as feedback in a form, that should be
 * preferred over relying on this API to display the error. The main use of this API
 * for displaying errors should be for asynchronous errors, such as a failing background process.
 *
 * Even if an error is displayed inline, it should still be reported through this API
 * if it would be useful to collect or log it for debugging purposes, but with
 * the hidden flag set. For example, an error arising from form field validation
 * should probably not be reported, while a failed REST call would be useful to report.
