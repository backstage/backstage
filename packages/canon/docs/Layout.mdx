<Text>
  Canon is made for extensibility. We built this library to make it easy for any
  Backstage plugin creator to be able to build their ideas at speed ensuring
  consistency across the rest of your ecosystem. Each component is designed to
  be editable to match your need but sometimes you want to have more control
  over the layout of your page. To help you with that, we created a set of
  layout components that you can use to build your own layouts. All of these
  components are built to extend on our theming system, making it easy for you
  to build your own layouts. Sometimes these components are not enough so we
  created a set of helpers to be used with any CSS-in-JS library.

<Text>
  We built a couple of layout components to help you build responsive elements
  that will be consistent with the rest of your Backstage instance. These
  components are opinionated and use TypeScript to ensure that the props you
  provide are the ones coming from the theme.
