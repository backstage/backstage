<Text>
  All our default icons are provided by [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/). We
  don't import all icons to reduce the bundle size but we cherry pick a nice
  selection for you to use in your application. The list of names is set down
  below. To use an icon, you can use the `Icon` component and pass the name of
  the icon you want to use.
