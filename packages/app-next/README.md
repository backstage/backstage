# example-app-next

This package is an example of a Backstage application using the [new frontend](../../docs/frontend-system/index.md).

To play with it, open a terminal and run the command: `yarn start`

**NOTE:** Don't forget to open a second terminal and to launch the backend there, using `yarn start`! The frontend requires a backend to connect to.
