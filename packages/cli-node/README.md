# @backstage/cli-node

This library provides utilities for building CLI tools for Backstage.

The difference between this library and `@backstage/cli-common` is that this library is more feature rich with a larger dependency tree, with less concern for bundle size and installation speed. The `@backstage/cli-common` package on the other hand is intended to be extremely slim and only provide minimal features for use in tools like `@backstage/create-app`.
