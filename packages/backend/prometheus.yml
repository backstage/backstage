# This is an example configuration file for Prometheus, that is set to scrape

# If you want to run a docker based Prometheus instance locally to try it out,
# run the following command in the Backstage root:
#
# docker run --mount type=bind,source=./packages/backend/prometheus.yml,destination=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml --publish published=9090,target=9090,protocol=tcp prom/prometheus
#
# After this, you have a Prometheus instance on http://localhost:9090
