# This dockerfile builds an image for the backend package.
# It should be executed with the root of the repo as docker context.
#
# Before building this image, be sure to have run the following commands in the repo root:
#
# yarn install
# yarn tsc
# yarn build
#
# Once the commands have been run, you can build the image using `yarn build-image`

# These three lines are in place to install python3, pip3 and mkdocs so that we can generate
# within the application.  When we get to a point where BIH is just reading, we
# can start to remove this piece and lighten the load on the backend of the application.
# This can be removed and in the case that we are utilizing AWS S3, but if locally you
# are just wanting to use local docs, then this needs to be included.
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-pip
# RUN pip3 install --upgrade pip && pip3 install mkdocs-techdocs-core==0.0.16

# Copy repo skeleton first, to avoid unnecessary docker cache invalidation.
# The skeleton contains the package.json of each package in the monorepo,
# and along with yarn.lock and the root package.json, that's enough to run yarn install.

RUN yarn config set "strict-ssl" false -g
RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile --production --network-timeout 300000 && rm -rf "$(yarn cache dir)"

# Then copy the rest of the backend bundle, along with any other files we might want.
