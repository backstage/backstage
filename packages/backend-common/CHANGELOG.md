# @backstage/backend-common

## 0.8.7

### Patch Changes

- f25357273: Implement the etag functionality in the `readUrl` method of `FetchUrlReader`.
- bdd6ab5f1: It's possible to customize the request logging handler when building the service. For example in your `backend`

  ```
    const service = createServiceBuilder(module)
      .loadConfig(config)
      .setRequestLoggingHandler((logger?: Logger): RequestHandler => {
        const actualLogger = (logger || getRootLogger()).child({
          type: 'incomingRequest',
        });
        return expressWinston.logger({ ...
  ```

## 0.8.6

### Patch Changes

- 5f6f2fd96: Support a `ensureExists` config option to skip ensuring a configured database exists. This allows deployment scenarios where
  limited permissions are given for provisioned databases without privileges to create new databases. If set to `false`, the
  database connection will not be validated prior to use which means the backend will not attempt to create the database if it
  doesn't exist. You can configure this in your app-config.yaml:

  ```yaml
  backend:
    database:
      ensureExists: false
  ```

  This defaults to `true` if unspecified. You can also configure this per plugin connection and will override the base option.

- ad93bb035: Document the default behavior of `statusCheck` option in `createStatusCheckRouter`.
- ae84b20cf: Revert the upgrade to `fs-extra@10.0.0` as that seemed to have broken all installs inexplicably.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.6.5

## 0.8.5

### Patch Changes

- 09d3eb684: Added a `readUrl` method to the `UrlReader` interface that allows for complex response objects and is intended to replace the `read` method. This new method is currently optional to implement which allows for a soft migration to `readUrl` instead of `read` in the future.

  The main use case for `readUrl` returning an object instead of solely a read buffer is to allow for additional metadata such as ETag, which is a requirement for more efficient catalog processing.

  The `GithubUrlReader` and `GitlabUrlReader` readers fully implement `readUrl`. The other existing readers implement the new method but do not propagate or return ETags.

  While the `readUrl` method is not yet required, it will be in the future, and we already log deprecation warnings when custom `UrlReader` implementations that do not implement `readUrl` are used. We therefore recommend that any existing custom implementations are migrated to implement `readUrl`.

  The old `read` and the new `readUrl` methods can easily be implemented using one another, but we recommend moving the chunk of the implementation to the new `readUrl` method as `read` is being removed, for example this:

  ```ts
  class CustomUrlReader implements UrlReader {
    read(url: string): Promise<Buffer> {
      const res = await fetch(url);

      if (!res.ok) {
        // error handling ...
      }

      return Buffer.from(await res.text());
    }
  }
  ```

  Can be migrated to something like this:

  ```ts
  class CustomUrlReader implements UrlReader {
    read(url: string): Promise<Buffer> {
      const res = await this.readUrl(url);
      return res.buffer();
    }

    async readUrl(
      url: string,
      _options?: ReadUrlOptions,
    ): Promise<ReadUrlResponse> {
      const res = await fetch(url);

      if (!res.ok) {
        // error handling ...
      }

      const buffer = Buffer.from(await res.text());
      return { buffer: async () => buffer };
    }
  }
  ```

  While there is no usage of the ETag capability yet in the main Backstage packages, you can already add it to your custom implementations. To do so, refer to the documentation of the `readUrl` method and surrounding types, and the existing implementation in `packages/backend-common/src/reading/GithubUrlReader.ts`.

## 0.8.3

### Patch Changes

- e5cdf0560: Provide a more clear error message when database connection fails.
- 772dbdb51: Deprecates `SingleConnectionDatabaseManager` and provides an API compatible database
  connection manager, `DatabaseManager`, which allows developers to configure database
  connections on a per plugin basis.

  The `backend.database` config path allows you to set `prefix` to use an
  alternate prefix for automatically generated database names, the default is
  `backstage_plugin_`. Use `backend.database.plugin.<pluginId>` to set plugin
  specific database connection configuration, e.g.

  ```yaml
  backend:
    database:
      client: 'pg',
      prefix: 'custom_prefix_'
      connection:
        host: 'localhost'
        user: 'foo'
        password: 'bar'
      plugin:
        catalog:
          connection:
            database: 'database_name_overriden'
        scaffolder:
          client: 'sqlite3'
          connection: ':memory:'
  ```

  Migrate existing backstage installations by swapping out the database manager in the
  `packages/backend/src/index.ts` file as shown below:

  ```diff
  import {
  -  SingleConnectionDatabaseManager,
  +  DatabaseManager,
  } from '@backstage/backend-common';

  // ...

  function makeCreateEnv(config: Config) {
    // ...
  -  const databaseManager = SingleConnectionDatabaseManager.fromConfig(config);
  +  const databaseManager = DatabaseManager.fromConfig(config);
    // ...
  }
  ```

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 92963779b: Omits the `upgrade-insecure-requests` Content-Security-Policy directive by default, to prevent automatic HTTPS request upgrading for HTTP-deployed Backstage sites.

  If you previously disabled this using `false` in your `app-config.yaml`, this line is no longer necessary:

  ```diff
  backend:
    csp:
  -    upgrade-insecure-requests: false
  ```

  To keep the existing behavior of `upgrade-insecure-requests` Content-Security-Policy being _enabled_, add the key with an empty array as the value in your `app-config.yaml`:

  ```diff
  backend:
  +  csp:
  +    upgrade-insecure-requests: []
  ```

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- c7dad9218: All cache-related connection errors are now handled and logged by the cache manager. App Integrators may provide an optional error handler when instantiating the cache manager if custom error handling is needed.

  ```typescript
  // Providing an error handler
  const cacheManager = CacheManager.fromConfig(config, {
    onError: e => {
      if (isSomehowUnrecoverable(e)) {
        gracefullyShutThingsDown();
        process.exit(1);
      }
    },
  });
  ```

  - @backstage/integration@0.5.3
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.6.2

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 22fd8ce2a: Introducing: a standard API for App Integrators to configure cache stores and Plugin Developers to interact with them.

  Two cache stores are currently supported.

  - `memory`, which is a very simple in-memory key/value store, intended for local development.
  - `memcache`, which can be used to connect to a memcache host.

  Configuring and working with cache stores is very similar to the process for database connections.

  ```yaml
  backend:
    cache:
      store: memcache
      connection: user:pass@cache.example.com:11211
  ```

  ```typescript
  import { CacheManager } from '@backstage/backend-common';

  // Instantiating a cache client for a plugin.
  const cacheManager = CacheManager.fromConfig(config);
  const somePluginCache = cacheManager.forPlugin('somePlugin');
  const cacheClient = somePluginCache.getClient();

  // Using the cache client:
  const cachedValue = await cacheClient.get('someKey');
  if (cachedValue) {
    return cachedValue;
  } else {
    const someValue = await someExpensiveProcess();
    await cacheClient.set('someKey', someValue);
  }
  await cacheClient.delete('someKey');
  ```

  Cache clients deal with TTLs in milliseconds. A TTL can be provided as a defaultTtl when getting a client, or may be passed when setting specific objects. If no TTL is provided, data will be persisted indefinitely.

  ```typescript
  // Getting a client with a default TTL
  const cacheClient = somePluginCache.getClient({
    defaultTtl: 3600000,
  });

  // Setting a TTL on a per-object basis.
  cacheClient.set('someKey', data, { ttl: 3600000 });
  ```

  Configuring a cache store is optional. Even when no cache store is configured, the cache manager will dutifully pass plugins a manager that resolves a cache client that does not actually write or read any data.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e0bfd3d44: Refactor the `runDockerContainer(…)` function to an interface-based api.
  This gives the option to replace the docker runtime in the future.

  Packages and plugins that previously used the `dockerode` as argument should be migrated to use the new `ContainerRunner` interface instead.

  ```diff
    import {
  -   runDockerContainer,
  +   ContainerRunner,
      PluginEndpointDiscovery,
    } from '@backstage/backend-common';
  - import Docker from 'dockerode';

    type RouterOptions = {
      // ...
  -   dockerClient: Docker,
  +   containerRunner: ContainerRunner;
    };

    export async function createRouter({
      // ...
  -   dockerClient,
  +   containerRunner,
    }: RouterOptions): Promise<express.Router> {
      // ...

  +   await containerRunner.runContainer({
  -   await runDockerContainer({
        image: 'docker',
        // ...
  -     dockerClient,
      });

      // ...
    }
  ```

  To keep the `dockerode` based runtime, use the `DockerContainerRunner` implementation:

  ```diff
  + import {
  +   ContainerRunner,
  +   DockerContainerRunner
  + } from '@backstage/backend-common';
  - import { runDockerContainer } from '@backstage/backend-common';

  + const containerRunner: ContainerRunner = new DockerContainerRunner({dockerClient});
  + await containerRunner.runContainer({
  - await runDockerContainer({
      image: 'docker',
      // ...
  -   dockerClient,
    });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 37e3a69f5: Export `ReadTreeResponseFile` and `SearchResponseFile`.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 8686eb38c: Encode thrown errors in the backend as a JSON payload. This is technically a breaking change, since the response format even of errors are part of the contract. If you relied on the response being text, you will now have some extra JSON "noise" in it. It should still be readable by end users though.

  Before:

  ```
  NotFoundError: No entity named 'tara.macgovern2' found, with kind 'user' in namespace 'default'
      at eval (webpack-internal:///../../plugins/catalog-backend/src/service/router.ts:117:17)
  ```

  After:

  ```json
  {
    "error": {
      "name": "NotFoundError",
      "message": "No entity named 'tara.macgovern2' found, with kind 'user' in namespace 'default'",
      "stack": "NotFoundError: No entity named 'tara.macgovern2' found, with kind 'user' in namespace 'default'\n    at eval (webpack-internal:///../../plugins/catalog-backend/src/service/router.ts:117:17)"
    },
    "request": {
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "/entities/by-name/user/default/tara.macgovern2"
    },
    "response": {
      "statusCode": 404
    }
  }
  ```

- 8686eb38c: Removed the custom error types (e.g. `NotFoundError`). Those are now instead in the new `@backstage/errors` package. This is a breaking change, and you will have to update your imports if you were using these types.

  ```diff
  -import { NotFoundError } from '@backstage/backend-common';
  +import { NotFoundError } from '@backstage/errors';
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [0434853a5]
  - @backstage/config@0.1.4

## 0.5.6

### Patch Changes

- d7245b733: Add a utility function runDockerContainer used to run a docker container (currently used by Scaffolder and TechDocs for their 'generate' processes)
- 761698831: Bump to the latest version of the Knex library.

  You will most likely want to bump your own `packages/backend/package.json` as well:

  ```diff
  -    "knex": "^0.21.18",
  +    "knex": "^0.95.1",
  ```

  Note that the recent versions of the Knex library have some changes that may affect your internal plugins' database migration files. Importantly, they now support `ALTER TABLE` on SQLite, and no longer accidentally remove indices when making some modifications. It now also exports the `Knex` typescript type as a named export.

  ```ts
  import { Knex } from 'knex';
  ```

  - @backstage/integration@0.4.0

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 2430ee7c2: Updated the `rootLogger` in `@backstage/backend-common` to support custom logging options. This is useful when you want to make some changes without re-implementing the entire logger and calling `setRootLogger` or `logger.configure`. For example you can add additional `defaultMeta` tags to each log entry. The following changes are included:

  - Added `createRootLogger` which accepts winston `LoggerOptions`. These options allow overriding the default keys.

  Example Usage:

  ```ts
  // Create the logger
  const logger = createRootLogger({
    defaultMeta: { appName: 'backstage', appEnv: 'prod' },
  });

  // Add a custom logger transport
  logger.add(new MyCustomTransport());

  const config = await loadBackendConfig({
    argv: process.argv,
    logger: getRootLogger(), // already set to new logger instance
  });
  ```

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 26a3a6cf0: Honor the branch ref in the url when cloning.

  This fixes a bug in the scaffolder prepare stage where a non-default branch
  was specified in the scaffolder URL but the default branch was cloned.
  For example, even though the `other` branch is specified in this example, the
  `master` branch was actually cloned:

  ```yaml
  catalog:
    locations:
      - type: url
        target: https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/other/plugins/scaffolder-backend/sample-templates/docs-template/template.yaml
  ```

  This also fixes a 404 in the prepare stage for GitLab URLs.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 5345a1f98: Remove fallback option from `UrlReaders.create` and `UrlReaders.default`, as well as the default fallback reader.

  To be able to read data from endpoints outside of the configured integrations, you now need to explicitly allow it by
  adding an entry in the `backend.reading.allow` list. For example:

  ```yml
  backend:
    baseUrl: ...
    reading:
      allow:
        - host: example.com
        - host: '*.examples.org'
  ```

  Apart from adding the above configuration, most projects should not need to take any action to migrate existing code. If you do happen to have your own fallback reader configured, this needs to be replaced with a reader factory that selects a specific set of URLs to work with. If you where wrapping the existing fallback reader, the new one that handles the allow list is created using `FetchUrlReader.factory`.

- 09a370426: Remove support for HTTPS certificate generation parameters. Use `backend.https = true` instead.

### Patch Changes

- 0b135e7e0: Add support for GitHub Apps authentication for backend plugins.

  `GithubCredentialsProvider` requests and caches GitHub credentials based on a repository or organization url.

  The `GithubCredentialsProvider` class should be considered stateful since tokens will be cached internally.
  Consecutive calls to get credentials will return the same token, tokens older than 50 minutes will be considered expired and reissued.
  `GithubCredentialsProvider` will default to the configured access token if no GitHub Apps are configured.

  More information on how to create and configure a GitHub App to use with backstage can be found in the documentation.

  Usage:

  ```javascript
  const credentialsProvider = new GithubCredentialsProvider(config);
  const { token, headers } = await credentialsProvider.getCredentials({
    url: 'https://github.com/',
  });
  ```

  Updates `GithubUrlReader` to use the `GithubCredentialsProvider`.

- 294a70cab: 1. URL Reader's `readTree` method now returns an `etag` in the response along with the blob. The etag is an identifier of the blob and will only change if the blob is modified on the target. Usually it is set to the latest commit SHA on the target.

  `readTree` also takes an optional `etag` in its options and throws a `NotModifiedError` if the etag matches with the etag of the resource.

  So, the `etag` can be used in building a cache when working with URL Reader.

  An example -

  ```ts
  const response = await reader.readTree(
    'https://github.com/backstage/backstage',
  );

  const etag = response.etag;

  // Will throw a new NotModifiedError (exported from @backstage/backstage-common)
  await reader.readTree('https://github.com/backstage/backstage', {
    etag,
  });
  ```

  2. URL Reader's readTree method can now detect the default branch. So, `url:https://github.com/org/repo/tree/master` can be replaced with `url:https://github.com/org/repo` in places like `backstage.io/techdocs-ref`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 12bbd748c: Removes the Prometheus integration from `backend-common`.

  Rational behind this change is to keep the metrics integration of Backstage
  generic. Instead of directly relying on Prometheus, Backstage will expose
  metrics in a generic way. Integrators can then export the metrics in their
  desired format. For example using Prometheus.

  To keep the existing behavior, you need to integrate Prometheus in your
  backend:

  First, add a dependency on `express-prom-bundle` and `prom-client` to your backend.

  ```diff
  // packages/backend/package.json
    "dependencies": {
  +   "express-prom-bundle": "^6.1.0",
  +   "prom-client": "^12.0.0",
  ```

  Then, add a handler for metrics and a simple instrumentation for the endpoints.

  ```typescript
  // packages/backend/src/metrics.ts
  import { useHotCleanup } from '@backstage/backend-common';
  import { RequestHandler } from 'express';
  import promBundle from 'express-prom-bundle';
  import prom from 'prom-client';
  import * as url from 'url';

  const rootRegEx = new RegExp('^/([^/]*)/.*');
  const apiRegEx = new RegExp('^/api/([^/]*)/.*');

  export function normalizePath(req: any): string {
    const path = url.parse(req.originalUrl || req.url).pathname || '/';

    // Capture /api/ and the plugin name
    if (apiRegEx.test(path)) {
      return path.replace(apiRegEx, '/api/$1');
    }

    // Only the first path segment at root level
    return path.replace(rootRegEx, '/$1');
  }

  /**
   * Adds a /metrics endpoint, register default runtime metrics and instrument the router.
   */
  export function metricsHandler(): RequestHandler {
    // We can only initialize the metrics once and have to clean them up between hot reloads
    useHotCleanup(module, () => prom.register.clear());

    return promBundle({
      includeMethod: true,
      includePath: true,
      // Using includePath alone is problematic, as it will include path labels with high
      // cardinality (e.g. path params). Instead we would have to template them. However, this
      // is difficult, as every backend plugin might use different routes. Instead we only take
      // the first directory of the path, to have at least an idea how each plugin performs:
      normalizePath,
      promClient: { collectDefaultMetrics: {} },
    });
  }
  ```

  Last, extend your router configuration with the `metricsHandler`:

  ```diff
  +import { metricsHandler } from './metrics';

  ...

    const service = createServiceBuilder(module)
      .loadConfig(config)
      .addRouter('', await healthcheck(healthcheckEnv))
  +   .addRouter('', metricsHandler())
      .addRouter('/api', apiRouter);
  ```

  Your Prometheus metrics will be available at the `/metrics` endpoint.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1722cb53c: Added support for loading and validating configuration schemas, as well as declaring config visibility through schemas.

  The new `loadConfigSchema` function exported by `@backstage/config-loader` allows for the collection and merging of configuration schemas from all nearby dependencies of the project.

  A configuration schema is declared using the `https://backstage.io/schema/config-v1` JSON Schema meta schema, which is based on draft07. The only difference to the draft07 schema is the custom `visibility` keyword, which is used to indicate whether the given config value should be visible in the frontend or not. The possible values are `frontend`, `backend`, and `secret`, where `backend` is the default. A visibility of `secret` has the same scope at runtime, but it will be treated with more care in certain contexts, and defining both `frontend` and `secret` for the same value in two different schemas will result in an error during schema merging.

  Packages that wish to contribute configuration schema should declare it in a root `"configSchema"` field in `package.json`. The field can either contain an inlined JSON schema, or a relative path to a schema file. Schema files can be in either `.json` or `.d.ts` format.

  TypeScript configuration schema files should export a single `Config` type, for example:

  ```ts
  export interface Config {
    app: {
      /**
       * Frontend root URL
       * @visibility frontend
       */
      baseUrl: string;
    };
  }
  ```

### Minor Changes

- 5249594c5: Add service discovery interface and implement for single host deployments

  Fixes #1847, #2596

  Went with an interface similar to the frontend DiscoveryApi, since it's dead simple but still provides a lot of flexibility in the implementation.

  Also ended up with two different methods, one for internal endpoint discovery and one for external. The two use-cases are explained a bit more in the docs, but basically it's service-to-service vs callback URLs.

  This did get me thinking about uniqueness and that we're heading towards a global namespace for backend plugin IDs. That's probably fine, but if we're happy with that we should leverage it a bit more to simplify the backend setup. For example we'd have each plugin provide its own ID and not manually mount on paths in the backend.

  Draft until we're happy with the implementation, then I can add more docs and changelog entry. Also didn't go on a thorough hunt for places where discovery can be used, but I don't think there are many since it's been pretty awkward to do service-to-service communication.

- 56e4eb589: Make CSP configurable to fix app-backend served app not being able to fetch

  See discussion [here on discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/687207715902193673/687235481154617364/758721460163575850)

- e37c0a005: Use localhost to fall back to IPv4 if IPv6 isn't available
- f00ca3cb8: Auto-create plugin databases

  Relates to #1598.

  This creates databases for plugins before handing off control to plugins.

  The list of plugins currently need to be hard-coded depending on the installed plugins. A later PR will properly refactor the code to provide a factory pattern where plugins specify what they need, and Knex instances will be provided based on the input.

- 6579769df: Add the ability to import components from Bitbucket Server to the service catalog
- 8c2b76e45: **BREAKING CHANGE**

  The existing loading of additional config files like `app-config.development.yaml` using APP_ENV or NODE_ENV has been removed.
  Instead, the CLI and backend process now accept one or more `--config` flags to load config files.

  Without passing any flags, `app-config.yaml` and, if it exists, `app-config.local.yaml` will be loaded.
  If passing any `--config <path>` flags, only those files will be loaded, **NOT** the default `app-config.yaml` one.

  The old behaviour of for example `APP_ENV=development` can be replicated using the following flags:

  ```bash
  --config ../../app-config.yaml --config ../../app-config.development.yaml
  ```

- 8afce088a: Use APP_ENV before NODE_ENV for determining what config to load
- 7bbeb049f: Change loadBackendConfig to return the config directly

### Patch Changes

- 440a17b39: Added new UrlReader interface for reading opaque data from URLs with different providers.

  This new URL reading system is intended as a replacement for the various integrations towards
  external systems in the catalog, scaffolder, and techdocs. It is configured via a new top-level
  config section called 'integrations'.

  Along with the UrlReader interface is a new UrlReaders class, which exposes static factory
  methods for instantiating readers that can read from many different integrations simultaneously.
