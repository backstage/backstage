 * The PluginEndpointDiscovery is used to provide a mechanism for backend

 * The purpose of the discovery API is to allow for many different deployment
 * setups and routing methods through a central configuration, instead
 * of letting each individual plugin manage that configuration.
 *
 * Implementations of the discovery API can be as simple as a URL pattern
 * using the pluginId, but could also have overrides for individual plugins,
 * or query a separate discovery service.

   * communication within a Backstage backend deployment.
   *
   * This method must always be called just before making a request, as opposed to
   * fetching the URL when constructing an API client. That is to ensure that more
   * flexible routing patterns can be supported.
