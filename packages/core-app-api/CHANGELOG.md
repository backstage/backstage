# @backstage/core-app-api

## 1.15.2

### Patch Changes

  - @backstage/types@1.2.0
  - @backstage/core-plugin-api@1.10.1

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- ddbeace: Added the ability to explicitly disable routes through the `bindRoutes` option by passing `false` as the route target. This also fixes a bug where route bindings in config were incorrectly prioritized above the ones in code in certain situations.

### Patch Changes

- ea69e46: The `defaultConfigLoader` now also reads configuration from scripts tags with `type="backstage.io/config"`. The tag is expected to contain a JSON-serialized array of `AppConfig` objects. If any of these script tags are present, the injected runtime configuration in the static assets will no longer be used.
- b537bd7: Allow custom star icons to be provided via the `star` and `unstarred` icon overrides. See how to override existing icons in the [Backstage documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/app-custom-theme/#custom-icons).
- 836127c: Updated dependency `@testing-library/react` to `^16.0.0`.

## 1.14.2

### Patch Changes

- 9a46a81: The request to delete the session cookie when running the app in protected mode is now done with a plain `fetch` rather than `FetchApi`. This fixes a bug where the app would immediately try to sign-in again when removing the cookie during logout.

## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- d3c39fc: Allow for the disabling of external routes through config, which was rendered impossible after the introduction of default targets.

  ```yaml
  app:
    routes:
      bindings:
        # This has the effect of removing the button for registering new
        # catalog entities in the scaffolder template list view
        scaffolder.registerComponent: false

## 1.12.6

### Patch Changes

- 35fbe09: Added support for configuration of route bindings through static configuration, and default targets for external route refs.

  In addition to configuring route bindings through code, it is now also possible to configure route bindings under the `app.routes.bindings` key, for example:

  ```yaml
  app:
    routes:
      bindings:
        catalog.createComponent: catalog-import.importPage
  ```

  Each key in the route binding object is of the form `<plugin-id>.<externalRouteName>`, where the route name is key used in the `externalRoutes` object passed to `createPlugin`. The value is of the same form, but with the name taken from the plugin `routes` option instead.

  The equivalent of the above configuration in code is the following:

  ```ts
  const app = createApp({
    // ...
    bindRoutes({ bind }) {
      bind(catalogPlugin.externalRoutes, {
        createComponent: catalogImportPlugin.routes.importPage,
      });
    },
  });
  ```

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/core-plugin-api@1.9.3
  - @backstage/config@1.2.0
  - @backstage/types@1.1.1
  - @backstage/version-bridge@1.0.8

## 1.12.5

### Patch Changes

- 1bed9a3: The Backstage identity session expiration check will no longer fall back to using the provider expiration. This was introduced to smooth out the rollout of Backstage release 1.18, and is no longer needed.

## 1.12.4

### Patch Changes

- c884b9a: The app is now aware of if it is being served from the `app-backend` with a separate public and protected bundles. When in protected mode the app will now continuously refresh the session cookie, as well as clear the cookie if the user signs out.

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 18619f793c94: Fixed two bugs in how the `OAuth2Session` type represents the underlying data. The `expiresAt` and `backstageIdentity` are now both optional, since that's what they are in practice. This is not considered a breaking change since it was effectively a bug in the modelling of the state that this type represents, and the type was not used in any other external contract.
- 18619f793c94: The `OAuth` class which is used by all OAuth providers will now consider both the session expiration of both the Backstage identity as well as the upstream identity provider, and refresh the session with either of them is about to expire.
- 6e30769cc627: Introduced experimental support for internationalization.

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 7908d72e033: Introduce a new global config parameter, `enableExperimentalRedirectFlow`. When enabled, auth will happen with an in-window redirect flow rather than through a popup window.
- c15e0cedbe1: The `AuthConnector` interface now supports specifying a set of scopes when
  refreshing a session. The `DefaultAuthConnector` implementation passes the
  `scope` query parameter to the auth-backend plugin appropriately. The
  `RefreshingAuthSessionManager` passes any scopes in its `GetSessionRequest`
  appropriately.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 456eaa8cf83: `OAuth2` now gets ID tokens from a session with the `openid` scope explicitly
  requested.

  This should not be considered a breaking change, because spec-compliant OIDC
  providers will already be returning ID tokens if and only if the `openid` scope
  is granted.

  This change makes the dependence explicit, and removes the burden on
  OAuth2-based providers which require an ID token (e.g. this is done by various
  default [auth handlers](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/identity-resolver/#authhandler)) to add
  `openid` to their default scopes. _That_ could carry another indirect benefit:
  by removing `openid` from the default scopes for a provider, grants for
  resource-specific access tokens can avoid requesting excess ID token-related
  scopes.

### Patch Changes

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e0d9c9559a: Added a new `AppRouter` component and `app.createRoot()` method that replaces `app.getRouter()` and `app.getProvider()`, which are now deprecated. The new `AppRouter` component is a drop-in replacement for the old router component, while the new `app.createRoot()` method is used instead of the old provider component.

  An old app setup might look like this:

  ```tsx
  const app = createApp(/* ... */);

  const AppProvider = app.getProvider();
  const AppRouter = app.getRouter();

  const routes = ...;

  const App = () => (
    <AppProvider>
      <AlertDisplay />
      <OAuthRequestDialog />
      <AppRouter>
        <Root>{routes}</Root>
      </AppRouter>
    </AppProvider>
  );

  export default App;
  ```

  With these new APIs, the setup now looks like this:

  ```tsx
  import { AppRouter } from '@backstage/core-app-api';

  const app = createApp(/* ... */);

  const routes = ...;

  export default app.createRoot(
    <>
      <AlertDisplay />
      <OAuthRequestDialog />
      <AppRouter>
        <Root>{routes}</Root>
      </AppRouter>
    </>,
  );
  ```

  Note that `app.createRoot()` accepts a React element, rather than a component.

### Patch Changes

- d3fea4ae0a: Internal fixes to avoid implicit usage of globals
- b05dcd5530: Move the `zod` dependency to a version that does not collide with other libraries
- b4b5b02315: Tweak feature flag registration so that it happens immediately before the first rendering of the app, rather than just after.
- 6870b43dd1: Fix for the automatic rewriting of base URLs.
- 203271b746: Prevent duplicate feature flag components from rendering in the settings when using <FeatureFlagged /> components
- 3280711113: Updated dependency `msw` to `^0.49.0`.
- 19356df560: Updated dependency `zen-observable` to `^0.9.0`.
- c3fa90e184: Updated dependency `zen-observable` to `^0.10.0`.
- 8015ff1258: Tweaked wording to use inclusive terminology
- 653d7912ac: Made `WebStorage` notify its subscribers when `localStorage` values change in other tabs/windows
- 63310e3987: Apps will now rewrite the `app.baseUrl` configuration to match the current `location.origin`. The `backend.baseUrl` will also be rewritten in the same way when the `app.baseUrl` and `backend.baseUrl` have matching origins. This will reduce the need for separate frontend builds for different environments.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9b737e5f2e: Updated the React Router wiring to make use of the new `basename` property of the router components in React Router v6 stable. To implement this, a new optional `basename` property has been added to the `Router` app component, which can be forwarded to the concrete router implementation in order to support this new behavior. This is done by default in any app that does not have a `Router` component override.
- 127fcad26d: Deprecated the `homepage` config as the component that used it - `HomepageTimer` - has been removed and replaced by the `HeaderWorldClock` in the home plugin

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- f959c22787: Asynchronous methods on the identity API can now reliably be called at any time, including early in the bootstrap process or prior to successful sign-in.

  Previously in such situations, a `Tried to access IdentityApi before app was loaded` error would be thrown. Now, those methods will wait and resolve eventually (as soon as a concrete identity API is provided).

- f050eec2c0: Added validation during the application startup that detects if there are any plugins present that have not had their required external routes bound. Failing the validation will cause a hard crash as it is a programmer error. It lets you detect early on that there are dangling routes, rather than having them cause an error later on.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a036b65c2f: **BREAKING CHANGE**

  The app `SignInPage` component has been updated to switch out the `onResult` callback for a new `onSignInSuccess` callback. This is an immediate breaking change without any deprecation period, as it was deemed to be the way of making this change that had the lowest impact.

  The new `onSignInSuccess` callback directly accepts an implementation of an `IdentityApi`, rather than a `SignInResult`. The `SignInPage` from `@backstage/core-component` has been updated to fit this new API, and as long as you pass on `props` directly you should not see any breakage.

  However, if you implement your own custom `SignInPage`, then this will be a breaking change and you need to migrate over to using the new callback. While doing so you can take advantage of the `UserIdentity.fromLegacy` helper from `@backstage/core-components` to make the migration simpler by still using the `SignInResult` type. This helper is also deprecated though and is only provided for immediate migration. Long-term it will be necessary to build the `IdentityApi` using for example `UserIdentity.create` instead.

  The following is an example of how you can migrate existing usage immediately using `UserIdentity.fromLegacy`:

  ```ts
  onResult(signInResult);
  // becomes
  onSignInSuccess(UserIdentity.fromLegacy(signInResult));
  ```

  The following is an example of how implement the new `onSignInSuccess` callback of the `SignInPage` using `UserIdentity.create`:

  ```ts
  const identityResponse = await authApi.getBackstageIdentity();
  // Profile is optional and will be removed, but allows the
  // synchronous getProfile method of the IdentityApi to be used.
  const profile = await authApi.getProfile();
  onSignInSuccess(
    UserIdentity.create({
      identity: identityResponse.identity,
      authApi,
      profile,
    }),
  );
  ```

## 0.1.24

### Patch Changes

- 0e7f256034: Fixed a bug where `useRouteRef` would fail in situations where relative navigation was needed and the app was is mounted on a sub-path. This would typically show up as a failure to navigate to a tab on an entity page.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/core-components@0.7.6
  - @backstage/theme@0.2.14
  - @backstage/core-plugin-api@0.2.2

## 0.1.23

### Patch Changes

- bab752e2b3: Change default port of backend from 7000 to 7007.

  This is due to the AirPlay Receiver process occupying port 7000 and preventing local Backstage instances on MacOS to start.

  You can change the port back to 7000 or any other value by providing an `app-config.yaml` with the following values:

  ```
  backend:
    listen: 0.0.0.0:7123
    baseUrl: http://localhost:7123
  ```

  More information can be found here: https://backstage.io/docs/conf/writing

- 000190de69: The `ApiRegistry` from `@backstage/core-app-api` class has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. To replace it, we have introduced two new helpers that are exported from `@backstage/test-utils`, namely `TestApiProvider` and `TestApiRegistry`.

  These two new helpers are more tailored for writing tests and development setups, as they allow for partial implementations of each of the APIs.

  When migrating existing code it is typically best to prefer usage of `TestApiProvider` when possible, so for example the following code:

  ```tsx
  render(
    <ApiProvider
      apis={ApiRegistry.from([
        [identityApiRef, mockIdentityApi as unknown as IdentityApi]
      ])}
    >
      {...}
    </ApiProvider>
  )
  ```

  Would be migrated to this:

  ```tsx
  render(
    <TestApiProvider apis={[[identityApiRef, mockIdentityApi]]}>
      {...}
    </TestApiProvider>
  )
  ```

  In cases where the `ApiProvider` is used in a more standalone way, for example to reuse a set of APIs across multiple tests, the `TestApiRegistry` can be used instead. Note that the `TestApiRegistry` only has a single static factory method, `.from()`, and it is slightly different from the existing `.from()` method on `ApiRegistry` in that it doesn't require the API pairs to be wrapped in an outer array.

  Usage that looks like this:

  ```ts
  const apis = ApiRegistry.with(
    identityApiRef,
    mockIdentityApi as unknown as IdentityApi,
  ).with(configApiRef, new ConfigReader({}));
  ```

  OR like this:

  ```ts
  const apis = ApiRegistry.from([
    [identityApiRef, mockIdentityApi as unknown as IdentityApi],
    [configApiRef, new ConfigReader({})],
  ]);
  ```

  Would be migrated to this:

  ```ts
  const apis = TestApiRegistry.from(
    [identityApiRef, mockIdentityApi],
    [configApiRef, new ConfigReader({})],
  );
  ```

  If your app is still using the `ApiRegistry` to construct the `apis` for `createApp`, we recommend that you move over to use the new method of supplying API factories instead, using `createApiFactory`.

## 0.1.22

### Patch Changes

- Reverted the `createApp` TypeScript type to match the one before version `0.1.21`, as it was an accidental breaking change.

## 0.1.21

### Patch Changes

- 0b1de52732: Migrated to using new `ErrorApiError` and `ErrorApiErrorContext` names.
- ecd1fcb80a: Deprecated the `BackstagePluginWithAnyOutput` type.
- 32bfbafb0f: Start exporting and marking several types as public to address errors in the API report.
- 014cbf8cb9: The `createApp` function from `@backstage/core-app-api` has been deprecated, with two new options being provided as a replacement.

  The first and most commonly used one is `createApp` from the new `@backstage/app-defaults` package, which behaves just like the existing `createApp`. In the future this method is likely to be expanded to add more APIs and other pieces into the default setup, for example the Utility APIs from `@backstage/integration-react`.

  The other option that we now provide is to use `createSpecializedApp` from `@backstage/core-app-api`. This is a more low-level API where you need to provide a full set of options, including your own `components`, `icons`, `defaultApis`, and `themes`. The `createSpecializedApp` way of creating an app is particularly useful if you are not using `@backstage/core-components` or Material UI, as it allows you to avoid those dependencies completely.

## 0.1.16

### Patch Changes

- d9fd798cc8: The Core App API now automatically instruments all route location changes using
  the new Analytics API. Each location change triggers a `navigate` event, which
  is an analogue of a "pageview" event in traditional web analytics systems. In
  addition to the path, these events provide plugin-level metadata via the
  analytics context, which can be useful for analyzing plugin usage:

  ```json
  {
    "action": "navigate",
    "subject": "/the-path/navigated/to?with=params#and-hashes",
    "context": {
      "extension": "App",
      "pluginId": "id-of-plugin-that-exported-the-route",
      "routeRef": "associated-route-ref-id"
    }
  }
  ```

  These events can be identified and handled by checking for the action
  `navigate` and the extension `App`.

- cfcb486aa: Add system icons for the built-in entity types and use them in the entity list of the `catalog-import` plugin.
- 392b36fa1: Added support for using authenticating via GitHub Apps in addition to GitHub OAuth Apps. It used to be possible to use GitHub Apps, but they did not handle session refresh correctly.

  Note that GitHub Apps handle OAuth scope at the app installation level, meaning that the `scope` parameter for `getAccessToken` has no effect. When calling `getAccessToken` in open source plugins, one should still include the appropriate scope, but also document in the plugin README what scopes are required in the case of GitHub Apps.

  In addition, the `authHandler` and `signInResolver` options have been implemented for the GitHub provider in the auth backend.

### Patch Changes

- 9bca2a252: Fixes a type bug where supplying all app icons to `createApp` was required, rather than just a partial list.
- 75b8537ce: This change adds automatic error boundaries around extensions.

  This means that all exposed parts of a plugin are wrapped in a general error boundary component, that is plugin aware. The default design for the error box is borrowed from `@backstage/errors`. To override the default "fallback", one must provide a component named `ErrorBoundaryFallback` to `createApp`, like so:

  ```ts
  const app = createApp({
    components: {
      ErrorBoundaryFallback: props => {
        // a custom fallback component
        return (
          <>
            <h1>Oops.</h1>
            <h2>
              The plugin {props.plugin.getId()} failed with{' '}
              {props.error.message}
            </h2>
            <button onClick={props.resetError}>Try again</button>
          </>
        );
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  The props here include:

  - `error`. An `Error` object or something that inherits it that represents the error that was thrown from any inner component.
  - `resetError`. A callback that will simply attempt to mount the children of the error boundary again.
  - `plugin`. A `BackstagePlugin` that can be used to look up info to be presented in the error message. For instance, you may want to keep a map of your internal plugins and team names or slack channels and present these when an error occurs. Typically, you'll do that by getting the plugin ID with `plugin.getId()`.

- da8cba44f: Deprecate and disable the extension creation methods, which were added to this package by mistake and should only exist within `@backstage/core-plugin-api`.
