# @backstage/cli-common

This package provides config loading functionality used by the backend, and CLI.

## Installation

Do not install this package directly, it is an internal package used by [@backstage/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/cli), and [@backstage/create-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/create-app). Depend on either of those instead.
