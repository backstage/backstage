## Overview

The Backstage backend comes packaged with a basic HTTP proxy, that can aid in
reaching backend service APIs from frontend plugin code. See
[Call Existing API](call-existing-api.md) for a description of when the proxy
can be the best choice for communicating with an API.

## Getting Started

The plugin is already added to a default Backstage project.

### New Backend

To add it to a project, add the following line in `packages/backend/src/index.ts`:

```ts
backend.add(import('@backstage/plugin-proxy-backend'));
```

### Old Backend

In `packages/backend/src/index.ts`:

```ts
backend.add(import('@backstage/plugin-proxy-backend'));
```

## Configuration

Configuration for the proxy plugin lives under a `proxy` root key of your
`app-config.yaml` file.

Example:

```yaml
# in app-config.yaml
proxy:
  endpoints:
    /simple-example: http://simple.example.com:8080
    '/larger-example/v1':
      target: http://larger.example.com:8080/svc.v1
      credentials: require
      headers:
        Authorization: ${EXAMPLE_AUTH_HEADER}
        # ...or interpolating a value into part of a string,
        # Authorization: Bearer ${EXAMPLE_AUTH_TOKEN}
```

Each key under the proxy configuration entry is a route to match, below the
prefix that the proxy plugin is mounted on. If it does not start with a slash,
one will be prefixed automatically. For example, if the backend mounts the proxy
plugin as `/proxy`, the above configuration will lead to the proxy acting on
backend requests to `/api/proxy/simple-example/...` and
`/api/proxy/larger-example/v1/...`.

The value inside each route is either a simple URL string, or an object on the
format accepted by
[http-proxy-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware).
Additionally, it has an optional `credentials` key which can have the following
values:

- `require`: Callers must provide Backstage user or service credentials with
  each request. The credentials are not forwarded to the proxy target. This is
  the default.
- `forward`: Callers must provide Backstage user or service credentials with
  each request, and those credentials are forwarded to the proxy target.
- `dangerously-allow-unauthenticated`: No Backstage credentials are required to
  access this proxy target. The target can still apply its own credentials
  checks, but the proxy will not help block non-Backstage-blessed callers. If
  you also add `allowedHeaders: ['Authorization']` to an endpoint configuration,
  then the Backstage token (if provided) WILL be forwarded.

Note that if you have `backend.auth.dangerouslyDisableDefaultAuthPolicy` set to
`true`, the `credentials` value does not apply; the proxy will behave as if all
endpoints were set to `dangerously-allow-unauthenticated`.

If the value is a string, it is assumed to correspond to:

```yaml
target: <the string>
changeOrigin: true
pathRewrite:
  '^<url prefix><the string>/': '/'
credentials: require
```

When the target is an object, it is given verbatim to `http-proxy-middleware`
except with the following caveats for convenience:

- If `changeOrigin` is not specified, it is set to `true`. This is the most
  commonly useful value.
- If `pathRewrite` is not specified, it is set to a single rewrite that removes
  the entire prefix and route. In the above example, a rewrite of
  `'^/api/proxy/larger-example/v1/': '/'` is added. That means that a request to
  `/api/proxy/larger-example/v1/some/path` will be translated to a request to
  `http://larger.example.com:8080/svc.v1/some/path`.
- If `credentials` is not specified, it is set to `require`.

There are also additional settings:

- `allowedMethods`: Limit the forwarded HTTP methods. For example
  `allowedMethods: ['GET']` enforces read-only access.
- `allowedHeaders`: A list of headers that should be forwarded to and received
  from the target.

By default, the proxy will only forward safe HTTP request headers to the target.
Those are based on the headers that are considered safe for CORS and includes
headers like `content-type` or `last-modified`, as well as all headers that are
set by the proxy. If the proxy should forward other headers like
`authorization`, this must be enabled by the `allowedHeaders` config, for
example `allowedHeaders: ['Authorization']`. This should help to not
accidentally forward confidential headers (`cookie`, `X-Auth-Request-User`) to
third-parties.

The same logic applies to headers that are sent from the target back to the
frontend.
