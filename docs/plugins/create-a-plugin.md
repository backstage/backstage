A Backstage Frontend Plugin adds functionality, via extensions, to the Backstage frontend web application.

To create a Backend Plugin, please see [Creating a Backend Plugin](./backend-plugin.md#creating-a-backend-plugin).

## Create a Frontend Plugin

To create a new frontend plugin from our predefined template, first make sure you've run `yarn install`, then run the
following on your command line (a shortcut to invoking the [`backstage-cli new --select plugin`](../tooling/cli/03-commands.md#new))
from the root of your project.

This will template out the files for a new Frontend Plugin into a folder based on the plugin ID that was provided.

The `App.tsx` file will also be updated to include a route to the new generated demo page, like so:

```tsx title=packages/app/src/App.tsx
<FlatRoutes>
  ...
  <Route path="/my-plugin" element={<MyPluginPage />} />
  ...
</FlatRoutes>
```

:::info
Important Advanced Note!

Placing `<MyPluginPage />` into the application is what registers everything in your plugin with the Backstage
application. Do not remove this unless you know what you are doing.

By default, plugins are discovered when the Backstage `AppManager` traverses the React node tree when React starts up.
When it finds a plugin extension in the visible React tree, it then "registers" the associated plugin and makes its apis
available to `useApi()`.
:::

> If the Backstage App is already running (with `yarn start` or `yarn dev`) you
> should be able to see the default page for your new plugin directly by
> navigating to `http://localhost:3000/my-plugin`.

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin
directory. Or by using the yarn workspace command, for example:

```bash
yarn workspace @backstage/plugin-my-plugin start # Also supports --check
```

This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster
startup and hot reloads. It is only meant for local development, and the setup
for it can be found inside the plugin's `dev/` directory.

### Other Plugin Library Package Types

There are other plugin library package types that you can chose from. To be able to
select the type when you create a new plugin just run: `yarn new`. You'll then be asked
what type of plugin you wish to create like this:
