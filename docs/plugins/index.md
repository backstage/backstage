# Plugins

Backstage is a single-page application composed of a set of plugins.

Our goal for the plugin ecosystem is that the definition of a plugin is flexible
enough to allow you to expose pretty much any kind of infrastructure or software
development tool as a plugin in Backstage. By following strong
[design guidelines](https://github.com/spotify/backstage/blob/master/docs/design.md)
we ensure the the overall user experience stays consistent between plugins.

## Creating a plugin

To create a plugin, follow the steps outlined
[here](https://github.com/spotify/backstage/blob/master/docs/getting-started/create-a-plugin.md).

## Suggesting a plugin

If you start developing a plugin that you aim to release as open source, we
suggest that you create a new
[new Issue](https://github.com/spotify/backstage/issues/new?template=plugin_template.md).
This helps the community know what plugins are in development.

You can also use this process if you have an idea for a good plugin but you hope
that someone else will pick up the work.
