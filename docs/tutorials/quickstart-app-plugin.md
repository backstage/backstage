title: Adding Custom Plugin to Existing Monorepo App

###### September 15th 2020 - v0.1.1-alpha.21

<br />

> This document takes you through setting up a new plugin for your existing
> monorepo with a _GitHub provider already setup_. If you don't have either of
> those, you can clone
> [simple-backstage-app](https://github.com/johnson-jesse/simple-backstage-app)
> which this document builds on.
>
> This document does not cover authoring a plugin for sharing with the Backstage
> community. That will have to be a later discussion.
>
> We start with a skeleton plugin install. And after verifying its
> functionality, extend the Sidebar to make our life easy. Finally, we add
> custom code to display GitHub repository information.
>
> This document assumes you have Node.js 12 active along with Yarn and Python.
> Please note, that at the time of this writing, the current version is
> 0.1.1-alpha.21. This guide can still be used with future versions, just,
> verify as you go. If you run into issues, you can compare your setup with mine

# The Skeleton Plugin

1. Start by using the built in creator. From the terminal and root of your
   project run: `yarn create-plugin`
1. Enter a plugin ID. I used `github-playground`
1. When the process finishes, let's start the backend:
   `yarn --cwd packages/backend start`
1. If you see errors starting, refer to
   [Auth Configuration](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/quickstart-app-auth#the-auth-configuration)
   for more information on environment variables.
1. And now the frontend, from a new terminal window and the root of your
   project: `yarn start`
1. As usual, a browser window should popup loading the App.
1. Now manually navigate to our plugin page from your browser:
   `http://localhost:3000/github-playground`
1. You should see successful verbiage for this endpoint,
   `Welcome to github-playground!`

# The Shortcut

Let's add a shortcut.

1. Open and modify `root: packages > app > src > components > Root.tsx` with the
   following:

```tsx
import GitHubIcon from '@material-ui/icons/GitHub';
...
<SidebarItem icon={GitHubIcon} to="github-playground" text="GitHub Repository" />
```

Simple! The App will reload with your changes automatically. You should now see
a GitHub icon displayed in the sidebar. Clicking that will link to our new
plugin. And now, the API fun begins.

# The Identity

Our first modification will be to extract information from the Identity API.

1. Start by opening
   `root: plugins > github-playground > src > components > ExampleComponent > ExampleComponent.tsx`
1. Add two new imports

```tsx
// Add identityApiRef to the list of imported from core
import { identityApiRef, useApi } from '@backstage/core';
```

3. Adjust the ExampleComponent from inline to block

_from inline:_

```tsx
const ExampleComponent = () => ( ... )
```

_to block:_

```tsx
const ExampleComponent = () => {

    return (
        ...
    )
}
```

4. Now add our hook and const data before the return statement

```tsx
// our API hook
const identityApi = useApi(identityApiRef);

// data to use
const userId = identityApi.getUserId();
const profile = identityApi.getProfile();
```

5. Finally, update the InfoCard's jsx to use our new data

```tsx
<InfoCard title={userId}>
  <Typography variant="body1">
    {`${profile.displayName} | ${profile.email}`}
  </Typography>
</InfoCard>
```

If everything is saved, you should see your name, id, and email on the
github-playground page. Our data accessed is synchronous. So we just grab and
go.

6. Here is the entire file for reference
   [ExampleComponent.tsx](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/contrib/docs/tutorials/quickstart-app-plugin/ExampleComponent.md)

# The Wipe

The last file we will touch is ExampleFetchComponent. Because of the number of
changes, let's start by wiping this component clean.

1. Start by opening
   `root: plugins > github-playground > src > components > ExampleFetchComponent > ExampleFetchComponent.tsx`
1. Replace everything in the file with the following:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useAsync } from 'react-use';
import Alert from '@material-ui/lab/Alert';
import {
  Table,
  TableColumn,
  Progress,
  githubAuthApiRef,
  useApi,
} from '@backstage/core';
import { graphql } from '@octokit/graphql';

const ExampleFetchComponent = () => {
  return <div>Nothing to see yet</div>;
};

export default ExampleFetchComponent;
```

3. Save that and ensure you see no errors. Comment out the unused imports if
   your linter gets in the way.

###### We will add a lot to this file for the sake of ease. Please don't do this in productional code!

# The Graph Model

GitHub has a GraphQL API available for interacting. Let's start by adding our
basic repository query

1. Add the query const statement outside ExampleFetchComponent

```tsx
const query = `{
  viewer {
    repositories(first: 100) {
      totalCount
      nodes {
        name
        createdAt
        description
        diskUsage
        isFork
      }
      pageInfo {
        endCursor
        hasNextPage
      }
    }
  }
}`;
```

2. Using this structure as a guide, we will break our query into type parts
3. Add the following outside of ExampleFetchComponent

```tsx
type Node = {
  name: string;
  createdAt: string;
  description: string;
  diskUsage: number;
  isFork: boolean;
};

type Viewer = {
  repositories: {
    totalCount: number;
    nodes: Node[];
    pageInfo: {
      endCursor: string;
      hasNextPage: boolean;
    };
  };
};
```

# The Table Model

Using Backstage's own component library, let's define a custom table. This
component will get used if we have data to display.

1. Add the following outside of ExampleFetchComponent

```tsx
type DenseTableProps = {
  viewer: Viewer;
};

export const DenseTable = ({ viewer }: DenseTableProps) => {
  const columns: TableColumn[] = [
    { title: 'Name', field: 'name' },
    { title: 'Created', field: 'createdAt' },
    { title: 'Description', field: 'description' },
    { title: 'Disk Usage', field: 'diskUsage' },
    { title: 'Fork', field: 'isFork' },
  ];

  return (
    <Table
      title="List Of User's Repositories"
      options={{ search: false, paging: false }}
      columns={columns}
      data={viewer.repositories.nodes}
    />
  );
};
```

# The Fetch

We're ready to flush out our fetch component

1. Add our api hook inside ExampleFetchComponent

```tsx
const auth = useApi(githubAuthApiRef);
```

2. The access token we need to make our GitHub request and the request itself is
   obtained in an asynchronous manner.
3. Add the useAsync block inside the ExampleFetchComponent

```tsx
const { value, loading, error } = useAsync(async (): Promise<any> => {
  const token = await auth.getAccessToken();

  const gqlEndpoint = graphql.defaults({
    // Uncomment baseUrl if using enterprise
    // baseUrl: 'https://github.MY-BIZ.com/api',
    headers: {
      authorization: `token ${token}`,
    },
  });
  const { viewer } = await gqlEndpoint(query);
  return viewer;
}, []);
```

4. The resolved data is conveniently destructured with `value` containing our
   Viewer type. `loading` as a boolean, self explanatory. And `error` which is
   present only if necessary. So let's use those as the first 3 of 4 multi
   return statements.
5. Add the _if return_ blocks below our async block

```tsx
if (loading) return <Progress />;
if (error) return <Alert severity="error">{error.message}</Alert>;
if (value && value.repositories) return <DenseTable viewer={value} />;
```

6. The third line here utilizes our custom table accepting our Viewer type.
7. Finally, we add our _else return_ block to catch any other scenarios.

```tsx
return (
  <Table
    title="List Of User's Repositories"
    options={{ search: false, paging: false }}
    columns={[]}
    data={[]}
  />
);
```

8. After saving that, and given we don't have any errors, you should see a table
   with basic information on your repositories.
9. Here is the entire file for reference
   [ExampleFetchComponent.tsx](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/contrib/docs/tutorials/quickstart-app-plugin/ExampleFetchComponent.md)
10. We finished! You should see your own GitHub repository's information
    displayed in a basic table. If you run into issues, you can compare the repo
    that backs this document,
    [simple-backstage-app-plugin](https://github.com/johnson-jesse/simple-backstage-app-plugin)

# Where to go from here

> Break apart ExampleFetchComponent into smaller logical parts contained in
> their own files. Rename your components to something other than ExampleXxx.
>
> You might be really proud of a plugin you develop. Follow this next tutorial
> for an in-depth look at publishing and including that for the entire Backstage
> community. [TODO](#).
