description: Reference documentation for configuring TechDocs using app-config.yaml
---

Using the `app-config.yaml` in the Backstage app, you can configure TechDocs
using several options. This page serves as a reference to all the available
configuration options for TechDocs.

```yaml
# File: app-config.yaml

techdocs:
  # techdocs.generator is used to configure how documentation sites are generated using MkDocs.

  generator:
    # techdocs.generator.runIn can be either 'docker' or 'local'. This is to determine how to run the generator - whether to
    # spin up the techdocs-container docker image or to run mkdocs locally (assuming all the dependencies are taken care of).
    # You want to change this to 'local' if you are running Backstage using your own custom Docker setup and want to avoid running
    # into Docker in Docker situation. Read more here
    # https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/getting-started#disable-docker-in-docker-situation-optional

    runIn: 'docker'

    # (Optional) techdocs.generator.dockerImage can be used to control the docker image used during documentation generation. This can be useful
    # if you want to use MkDocs plugins or other packages that are not included in the default techdocs-container (spotify/techdocs).
    # NOTE: This setting is only used when techdocs.generator.runIn is set to 'docker'.

    dockerImage: 'spotify/techdocs'

    # (Optional) techdocs.generator.pullImage can be used to disable pulling the latest docker image by default. This can be useful when you are
    # using a custom techdocs.generator.dockerImage and you have a custom docker login requirement. For example, you need to login to
    # AWS ECR to pull the docker image.
    # NOTE: Disabling this requires the docker image was pulled by other means before running the techdocs generator.

    pullImage: true

    # (Optional) techdocs.generator.defaultEditUri can be used to set a value that will be used by default for all generated techdocs that do not have an edit_uri value in the mkdocs.yml file.
    # if {docs_dir} is included in the string, the docs_dir provided in a mkdocs.yml will be used in this position if it exists otherwise it will default to 'docs'.

    defaultEditUri: 'edit/main/{docs_dir}'

    mkdocs:
      # (Optional)  techdocs.generator.omitTechdocsCoreMkdocsPlugin can be used to disable automatic addition of techdocs-core plugin to the mkdocs.yaml files.
      # Defaults to false, which means that the techdocs-core plugin is always added to the mkdocs file.
      omitTechdocsCorePlugin: false

      # (Optional and not recommended) Configures the techdocs generator to
      # attempt to ensure an index.md exists falling back to using <docs-dir>/README.md
      # or README.md in case a default <docs-dir>/index.md is not provided.
      # Note that https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#edit_uri behavior
      # will be broken in these scenarios.
      legacyCopyReadmeMdToIndexMd: false

      # (Optional) Configures the default plugins which should be added
      # automatically to every mkdocs.yaml file. This simplifies the usage as
      # e.g. styling plugins can be added once for all.
      # Make sure that the defined plugins are installed locally / in the Docker
      # image.
      # By default, only the techdocs-core plugin will be added (except if
      # omitTechdocsCorePlugin: true).
      defaultPlugins: ['techdocs-core']

  # techdocs.builder can be either 'local' or 'external'.
  # Using the default build strategy, if builder is set to 'local' and you open a TechDocs page,
  # techdocs-backend will try to generate the docs, publish to storage and show the generated docs afterwards.
  # This is the "Basic" setup of the TechDocs Architecture.
  # Using the default build strategy, if builder is set to 'external' (or anything other than 'local'), techdocs-backend
  # will only fetch the docs and will NOT try to generate and publish.
  # In this case, we assume that docs are being built by an external process (e.g. in the CI/CD pipeline of the repository).
  # This is the "Recommended" setup of the architecture.
  # Note that custom build strategies may alter this behaviour.
  # Read more about the "Basic" and "Recommended" setups here https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/architecture
  # Read more about build strategies here: https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/concepts#techdocs-build-strategy

  builder: 'local'

  # techdocs.publisher is used to configure the Storage option, whether you want to use the local filesystem to store generated docs
  # or you want to use External storage providers like Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3, etc.

  publisher:
    # techdocs.publisher.type can be - 'local' or 'googleGcs' or 'awsS3' or 'azureBlobStorage'.
    # When set to 'local', techdocs-backend will create a 'static' directory at its root to store generated documentation files.
    # When set to 'googleGcs', techdocs-backend will use a Google Cloud Storage Bucket to store generated documentation files.
    # When set to 'awsS3', techdocs-backend will use an Amazon Web Service (AWS) S3 bucket to store generated documentation files.

    type: 'local'

    # Optional when techdocs.publisher.type is set to 'local'.

    local:
      # (Optional). Set this to specify where the generated documentation is stored.

  # (Optional and not recommended) Prior to version [0.x.y] of TechDocs, docs
  # sites could only be accessed over paths with case-sensitive entity triplets
  # e.g. (namespace/Kind/name). If you are upgrading from an older version of
  # TechDocs and are unable to perform the necessary migration of files in your
  # external storage, you can set this value to `true` to temporarily revert to
  # the old, case-sensitive entity triplet behavior.
  legacyUseCaseSensitiveTripletPaths: false

  # techdocs.cache is optional, and is only recommended when you've configured
  # an external techdocs.publisher.type above. Also requires backend.cache to
  # be configured with a valid cache store. Configure techdocs.cache.ttl to
  # enable caching of techdocs assets.
  cache:
    # Represents the number of milliseconds a statically built asset should
    # stay cached. Cache invalidation is handled automatically by the frontend,
    # which compares the build times in cached metadata vs. canonical storage,
    # allowing long TTLs (e.g. 1 month/year)
    ttl: 3600000

    # (Optional) The time (in milliseconds) that the TechDocs backend will wait
    # for a cache service to respond before continuing on as though the cached
    # object was not found (e.g. when the cache sercice is unavailable). The
    # default value is 1000
    readTimeout: 500
