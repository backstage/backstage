These are the release notes for the v1.2.0 release of [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).

A huge thanks to the whole team of maintainers and contributors as well as the amazing Backstage Community for the hard work in getting this release developed and done.

## Highlights

### TechDocs

The TechDocs addon framework is now generally available! See the [TechDocs Addons](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/addons) documentation for more information on how to customize your views.

### New plugin: ADR

The new `@backstage/plugin-adr` lets you track your active ADRs inside Backstage! Contributed by [@kuangp](https://github.com/kuangp)

### New Plugin: CodeScene plugin

The CodeScene Backstage plugin exposes a page component that will list the existing projects and their analysis data on your CodeScene instance. Contributed by [@julio](https://github.com/julioz) [#10777](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/10777)

### New plugin: plugin-catalog-backend-module-gerrit

Gerrit integration is here! See docs on [gerrit discovery](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/gerrit/discovery) and [gerrit locations](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/gerrit/locations) for more information.
Contributed by [@anicke](https://github.com/anicke) [#10669](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/10669)

### Integrations

Bitbucket Server and Bitbucket Cloud have been split up internally as the feature sets differ slightly, new scaffolder actions and integrations config has been added to accommodate a gradual migration. Contributed by [@pjungermann](https://github.com/pjungermann)

### Backend-common

Server-to-server authentication tokens issued from a TokenManager (specifically, ServerTokenManager) now has an expiry time set, for one hour in the future from when issued. This improves security. The ability to pass in and validate tokens that either have a missing exp claim, or an exp claim that expired in the past, is now deprecated. Trying to do so will lead to logged warnings, and in a future release will instead lead to errors.
[#11262](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/11262)

### Kubernetes

Added support for `oidc` as an auth provider for kubernetes authentication and added an optional `oidcTokenProvider` config value. This will allow users to authenticate to kubernetes clusters using ID tokens obtained from the configured auth provider in their Backstage instance. Contributed by @dbravovmw(https://github.com/dbravovmw). #11328(https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/11328)

### Misc

The `TaskScheduleDefinition` of the backend task scheduler has been updated to also accept an options object containing duration information in the form of days, hours, seconds and so on. This allows for scheduling without importing luxon. [#11245](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/11245)
Added the ability to render a custom component when an entity is not found [#11047](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/11047)
