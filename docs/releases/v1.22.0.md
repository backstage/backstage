These are the release notes for the v1.22.0 release of [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).

A huge thanks to the whole team of maintainers and contributors as well as the amazing Backstage Community for the hard work in getting this release developed and done.

## Highlights

### Updates to new frontend system

There have been several updates to alpha packages in the new frontend system including a breaking change where the `app/router` extension was renamed to `app/root`. Furthermore `elements`, `wrappers`, and `router` were added as inputs to `app/root` making it possible to pass extensions into the root of the app.

### Plugins and modules migrated to the New Backend System

Some more features have been migrated to the new backend system:

- `@backstage/plugin-auth-backend-module-microsoft-provider`
- `@backstage/plugin-auth-backend-module-pinniped-provider`
- `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-openapi`
- `@backstage/plugin-events-backend-module-azure`
- `@backstage/plugin-events-backend-module-bitbucket-cloud`
- `@backstage/plugin-events-backend-module-gerrit`
- `@backstage/plugin-linguist`

### New plugin: App Visualizer

This release includes the new `@backstage/plugin-app-visualizer` package. This plugin for the new frontend system lets you browse and view the extension structure of your app as a graph, detailed list, or in text form.

### New feature: Dynamic Feature Service

This release includes the new `@backstage/backend-dynamic-feature-service` package.
It is a new and experimental service that lets you dynamically detect and load local plugins and modules in your Backstage instance.

## Security Fixes

This release does not contain any security fixes.

However, some updates were made to the build facilities in the CLI and the caches in the backend system, such that you can now perform builds on FIPS compliant systems. This may lead to some internal cache invalidation happening, since the hashing algorithms used were updated. This should not pose a problem unless caches were being used as reliable persistent storage systems. Please let us know if you encounter any issues that may be related to this.

## Upgrade path

We recommend that you keep your Backstage project up to date with this latest release. For more guidance on how to upgrade, check out the documentation for [keeping Backstage updated](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/keeping-backstage-updated).
