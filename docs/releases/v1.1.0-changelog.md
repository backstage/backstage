# Release v1.1.0

## @backstage/backend-tasks@0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ab008a0988: Adds the ability to manually trigger tasks which are registered

### Patch Changes

- bdd2773202: Refactored the internal `TaskWorker` class to make it easier to test.

- a83babdd63: Fixed the `initialDelay` parameter of tasks to properly make task workers
  _always_ wait before the first invocations on startup, not just the very first
  time that the task is ever created. This behavior is more in line with
  expectations. Callers to not need to update their code.

  Also clarified in the doc comment for the field that this wait applies only on
  an individual worker level. That is, if you have a cluster of workers then each
  individual machine may postpone its first task invocation by the given amount of
  time to leave room for the service to settle, but _other_ workers may still
  continue to invoke the task on the regular cadence in the meantime.

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/backend-common@0.13.2

## @backstage/cli@0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f7d4763ab: **BREAKING**: Bump the version range of `jest` from `^26.0.1` to `^27.5.1`. You can find the complete list of breaking changes [here](https://github.com/facebook/jest/releases/tag/v27.0.0).

  We strongly recommend to have completed the [package role migration](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/package-role-migration) before upgrading to this version, as the package roles are used to automatically determine the testing environment for each package. If you instead want to set an explicit test environment for each package, you can do so for example in the `"jest"` section in `package.json`. The default test environment for all packages is now `node`, which is also the new Jest default.

  Note that one of the breaking changes of Jest 27 is that the `jsdom` environment no longer includes `setImmediate` and `clearImmediate`, which means you might need to update some of your frontend packages. Another notable change is that `jest.useFakeTimers` now defaults to the `'modern'` implementation, which also mocks microtasks.

### Patch Changes

- ed3551b7be: Introduced a new experimental test configuration with a number of changes. It switches the coverage provider from `v8` to the default Babel provider, along with always enabling source maps in the Sucrase transform. It also adds a custom module loader that caches both file transforms and VM script objects across all projects in a test run, which provides a big performance boost when running tests from the project root, increasing speed and reducing memory usage.

  This new configuration is not enabled by default. It is enabled by setting the environment variable `BACKSTAGE_NEXT_TESTS` to a non-empty value.

- 6ad0c45648: Added an experimental `package fix` command which applies automated fixes to the target package. The initial fix that is available is to add missing monorepo dependencies to the target package.

- 5b3079694e: Stop logging "Stopped watcher" when shutting down the development backend.

- f512554910: Updated the plugin template to install version 14 of `@testing-library/user-event`.

  To apply this change to your own project, update the `devDependencies` section in your `package.json` files:

  ```diff
   "devDependencies": {
     ... omitted dev dependencies ...
  -   "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.1.8",
  +   "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.0.0",
      ... omitted dev dependencies ...
   }
  ```

- 4782f9e925: Fixed misleading log message during frontend plugin creation.

- 0383cd0228: The `versions:*` commands no longer warns about duplicate plugin libraries, such as `@backstage/plugin-catalog-common`.

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@1.1.0

## @backstage/config-loader@1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b7436743cb: Gerrit integration: Added an optional configuration to set the Gitiles base url.

### Patch Changes

- 1691c6c5c2: Clarify that config locations that emit User and Group kinds now need to declare so in the `catalog.locations.[].rules`

- 3ef123bbf0: Support external ID when assuming roles in S3 integration

  In order to assume a role created by a 3rd party as external
  ID is needed. This change adds an optional field to the s3
  integration configuration and consumes that in the AwsS3UrlReader.

- d26e1b0146: Exported `replaceGitLabUrlType` from package

## @techdocs/cli@1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 733187987b: Removed an undocumented, broken behavior where `README.md` files would be copied to `index.md` if it did not exist, leading to broken links in the TechDocs UI.

  **WARNING**: If you notice 404s in TechDocs after updating, check to make sure that all markdown files referenced in your `mkdocs.yml`s' `nav` sections exist. The following flag may be passed to the `generate` command to temporarily revert to the broken behavior.

  ```sh
  techdocs-cli generate --legacyCopyReadmeMdToIndexMd
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 230ad0826f: Bump to using `@types/node` v16

  - @backstage/backend-common@0.13.2
  - @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node@1.1.0

## @backstage/plugin-auth-backend@0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 15d3a3c39a: **BREAKING**: All sign-in resolvers must now return a `token` in their sign-in result. Returning an `id` is no longer supported.
- c5aeaf339d: **BREAKING**: All auth providers have had their default sign-in resolvers removed. This means that if you want to use a particular provider for sign-in, you must provide an explicit sign-in resolver. For more information on how to configure sign-in resolvers, see the [sign-in resolver documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/identity-resolver).

### Patch Changes

- c5aeaf339d: **DEPRECATION**: The `AuthProviderFactoryOptions` type has been deprecated, as the options are now instead inlined in the `AuthProviderFactory` type. This will make it possible to more easily introduce new options in the future without a possibly breaking change.

- 794f7542b6: Updated openid-client from 4.1.2 to 5.1.3

- c5aeaf339d: **DEPRECATION**: The `getEntityClaims` helper has been deprecated, with `getDefaultOwnershipEntityRefs` being added to replace it.

- de231e5b06: Declare oauth2 `clientSecret` with visibility secret

- c5aeaf339d: **DEPRECATION**: All `create<Provider>Provider` and `<provider>*SignInResolver` have been deprecated. Instead, a single `providers` object is exported which contains all built-in auth providers.

  If you have a setup that currently looks for example like this:

  ```ts
  import {
    createRouter,
    defaultAuthProviderFactories,
    createGoogleProvider,
    googleEmailSignInResolver,
  } from '@backstage/plugin-auth-backend';
  import { Router } from 'express';
  import { PluginEnvironment } from '../types';

  export default async function createPlugin(
    env: PluginEnvironment,
  ): Promise<Router> {
    return await createRouter({
      ...env,
      providerFactories: {
        ...defaultAuthProviderFactories,
        google: createGoogleProvider({
          signIn: {
            resolver: googleEmailSignInResolver,
          },
        }),
      },
    });
  }
  ```

  You would migrate it to something like this:

  ```ts
  import {
    createRouter,
    providers,
    defaultAuthProviderFactories,
  } from '@backstage/plugin-auth-backend';
  import { Router } from 'express';
  import { PluginEnvironment } from '../types';

  export default async function createPlugin(
    env: PluginEnvironment,
  ): Promise<Router> {
    return await createRouter({
      ...env,
      providerFactories: {
        ...defaultAuthProviderFactories,
        google: providers.google.create({
          signIn: {
            resolver:
              providers.google.resolvers.emailMatchingUserEntityAnnotation(),
          },
        }),
      },
    });
  }
  ```

- 2cc1d1b235: Applied the fix from version 0.12.3 of this package, which is part of the v1.0.1 release of Backstage.

- c5aeaf339d: **DEPRECATION** The `AuthResolverContext` has received a number of changes, which is the context used by auth handlers and sign-in resolvers.

  The following fields deprecated: `logger`, `tokenIssuer`, `catalogIdentityClient`. If you need to access the `logger`, you can do so through a closure instead. The `tokenIssuer` has been replaced with an `issueToken` method, which is available directory on the context. The `catalogIdentityClient` has been replaced by the `signInWithCatalogUser` method, as well as the lower level `findCatalogUser` method and `getDefaultOwnershipEntityRefs` helper.

  It should be possible to migrate most sign-in resolvers to more or less only use `signInWithCatalogUser`, for example an email lookup resolver like this one:

  ```ts
  async ({ profile }, ctx) => {
    if (!profile.email) {
      throw new Error('Profile contained no email');
    }

    const entity = await ctx.catalogIdentityClient.findUser({
      annotations: {
        'acme.org/email': profile.email,
      },
    });

    const claims = getEntityClaims(entity);
    const token = await ctx.tokenIssuer.issueToken({ claims });

    return { id: entity.metadata.name, entity, token };
  };
  ```

  can be migrated to the following:

  ```ts
  async ({ profile }, ctx) => {
    if (!profile.email) {
      throw new Error('Profile contained no email');
    }

    return ctx.signInWithCatalogUser({
      annotations: {
        'acme.org/email': profile.email,
      },
    });
  };
  ```

  While a direct entity name lookup using a user ID might look like this:

  ```ts
  async ({ result: { fullProfile } }, ctx) => {
    return ctx.signInWithCatalogUser({
      entityRef: {
        name: fullProfile.userId,
      },
    });
  };
  ```

  If you want more control over the way that users are looked up, ownership is assigned, or tokens are issued, you can use a combination of the `findCatalogUser`, `getDefaultOwnershipEntityRefs`, and `issueToken` instead.

          ),

## @backstage/plugin-kubernetes-backend@0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 3d45427666: **BREAKING** Custom cluster suppliers need to cache their getClusters result

  To allow custom `KubernetesClustersSupplier` instances to refresh the list of clusters
  the `getClusters` method is now called whenever the list of clusters is needed.

  Existing `KubernetesClustersSupplier` implementations will need to ensure that `getClusters`
  can be called frequently and should return a cached result from `getClusters` instead.

  For example, here's a simple example of a custom supplier in `packages/backend/src/plugins/kubernetes.ts`:

  ```diff
  -import { KubernetesBuilder } from '@backstage/plugin-kubernetes-backend';
  +import {
  +  ClusterDetails,
  +  KubernetesBuilder,
  +  KubernetesClustersSupplier,
  +} from '@backstage/plugin-kubernetes-backend';
   import { Router } from 'express';
   import { PluginEnvironment } from '../types';
  +import { Duration } from 'luxon';
  +
  +export class CustomClustersSupplier implements KubernetesClustersSupplier {
  +  constructor(private clusterDetails: ClusterDetails[] = []) {}
  +
  +  static create(refreshInterval: Duration) {
  +    const clusterSupplier = new CustomClustersSupplier();
  +    // setup refresh, e.g. using a copy of https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/search-backend-node/src/runPeriodically.ts
  +    runPeriodically(
  +      () => clusterSupplier.refreshClusters(),
  +      refreshInterval.toMillis(),
  +    );
  +    return clusterSupplier;
  +  }
  +
  +  async refreshClusters(): Promise<void> {
  +    this.clusterDetails = []; // fetch from somewhere
  +  }
  +
  +  async getClusters(): Promise<ClusterDetails[]> {
  +    return this.clusterDetails;
  +  }
  +}

   export default async function createPlugin(
     env: PluginEnvironment,
   ): Promise<Router> {
  -  const { router } = await KubernetesBuilder.createBuilder({
  +  const builder = await KubernetesBuilder.createBuilder({
       logger: env.logger,
       config: env.config,
  -  }).build();
  +  });
  +  builder.setClusterSupplier(
  +    CustomClustersSupplier.create(Duration.fromObject({ minutes: 60 })),
  +  );
  +  const { router } = await builder.build();
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/catalog-model@1.0.1
  - @backstage/backend-common@0.13.2
  - @backstage/plugin-kubernetes-common@0.2.9

## @backstage/plugin-permission-common@0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 8012ac46a0: Add `resourceType` property to `PermissionCondition` type to allow matching them with `ResourcePermission` instances.
- c98d271466: Refactor api types into more specific, decoupled names.

  - **BREAKING:**
    - Renamed `AuthorizeDecision` to `EvaluatePermissionResponse`
    - Renamed `AuthorizeQuery` to `EvaluatePermissionRequest`
    - Renamed `AuthorizeRequest` to `EvaluatePermissionRequestBatch`
    - Renamed `AuthorizeResponse` to `EvaluatePermissionResponseBatch`
    - Renamed `Identified` to `IdentifiedPermissionMessage`
  - Add `PermissionMessageBatch` helper type
  - Add `ConditionalPolicyDecision`, `DefinitivePolicyDecision`, and `PolicyDecision` types from `@backstage/plugin-permission-node`

### Patch Changes

- 90754d4fa9: Removed [strict](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod#strict) validation from `PermissionCriteria` schemas to support backward-compatible changes.

- 2b07063d77: Added `PermissionEvaluator`, which will replace the existing `PermissionAuthorizer` interface. This new interface provides stronger type safety and validation by splitting `PermissionAuthorizer.authorize()` into two methods:

  - `authorize()`: Used when the caller requires a definitive decision.
  - `authorizeConditional()`: Used when the caller can optimize the evaluation of any conditional decisions. For example, a plugin backend may want to use conditions in a database query instead of evaluating each resource in memory.

- 8012ac46a0: Add `isPermission` helper method.

- 95284162d6: - Add more specific `Permission` types.
  - Add `createPermission` helper to infer the appropriate type for some permission input.
  - Add `isResourcePermission` helper to refine Permissions to ResourcePermissions.

## @backstage/plugin-permission-node@0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 8012ac46a0: **BREAKING**: Stronger typing in `PermissionPolicy` 🎉.

  Previously, it was entirely the responsibility of the `PermissionPolicy` author to only return `CONDITIONAL` decisions for permissions that are associated with a resource, and to return the correct kind of `PermissionCondition` instances inside the decision. Now, the policy authoring helpers provided in this package now ensure that the decision and permission match.

  **For policy authors**: rename and adjust api of `createConditionExports`. Previously, the function returned a factory for creating conditional decisions named `createPolicyDecision`, which had a couple of drawbacks:

  1.  The function always creates a _conditional_ policy decision, but this was not reflected in the name.
  2.  Conditional decisions should only ever be returned from `PermissionPolicy#handle` for resource permissions, but there was nothing in the API that encoded this constraint.

  This change addresses the drawbacks above by making the following changes for policy authors:

  - The `createPolicyDecision` method has been renamed to `createConditionalDecision`.
  - Along with conditions, the method now accepts a permission, which must be a `ResourcePermission`. This is expected to be the handled permission in `PermissionPolicy#handle`, whose type must first be narrowed using methods like `isPermission` and `isResourcePermission`:

  ```typescript
  class TestPermissionPolicy implements PermissionPolicy {
    async handle(
      request: PolicyQuery<Permission>,
      _user?: BackstageIdentityResponse,
    ): Promise<PolicyDecision> {
      if (
        // Narrow type of `request.permission` to `ResourcePermission<'catalog-entity'>
        isResourcePermission(request.permission, RESOURCE_TYPE_CATALOG_ENTITY)
      ) {
        return createCatalogConditionalDecision(
          request.permission,
          catalogConditions.isEntityOwner(
            _user?.identity.ownershipEntityRefs ?? [],
          ),
        );
      }

      return {
        result: AuthorizeResult.ALLOW,
      };
  ```

  **BREAKING**: when creating `PermissionRule`s, provide a `resourceType`.

  ```diff
  export const isEntityOwner = createCatalogPermissionRule({
    name: 'IS_ENTITY_OWNER',
    description: 'Allow entities owned by the current user',
  +  resourceType: RESOURCE_TYPE_CATALOG_ENTITY,
    apply: (resource: Entity, claims: string[]) => {
      if (!resource.relations) {
        return false;
      }

      return resource.relations
        .filter(relation => relation.type === RELATION_OWNED_BY)
        .some(relation => claims.includes(relation.targetRef));
    },
    toQuery: (claims: string[]) => ({
      key: 'relations.ownedBy',
      values: claims,
    }),
  });
  ```

- c98d271466: **BREAKING:**

  - Rename `PolicyAuthorizeQuery` to `PolicyQuery`
  - Remove `PolicyDecision`, `DefinitivePolicyDecision`, and `ConditionalPolicyDecision`. These types are now exported from `@backstage/plugin-permission-common`

- 322b69e46a: **BREAKING:** `ServerPermissionClient` now implements `PermissionEvaluator`, which moves out the capabilities for evaluating conditional decisions from `authorize()` to `authorizeConditional()` method.

## @backstage/plugin-search-backend@0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 94ccd772d4: **BREAKING**: The `authorization` property is no longer returned on search results when queried. Note: this will only result in a breaking change if you have custom code in your frontend that relies on the `authorization.resourceRef` property on documents.

  - @backstage/plugin-search-backend-node@0.6.0

## @backstage/plugin-search-backend-node@0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 0a63e99a26: **BREAKING**: `IndexBuilder.addCollator()` now requires a `schedule` parameter (replacing `defaultRefreshIntervalSeconds`) which is expected to be a `TaskRunner` that is configured with the desired search indexing schedule for the given collator.

  `Scheduler.addToSchedule()` now takes a new parameter object (`ScheduleTaskParameters`) with two new options `id` and `scheduledRunner` in addition to the migrated `task` argument.

  NOTE: The search backend plugin now creates a dedicated database for coordinating indexing tasks.

  To make this change to an existing app, make the following changes to `packages/backend/src/plugins/search.ts`:

  ```diff
  +import { Duration } from 'luxon';

  /* ... */

  +  const schedule = env.scheduler.createScheduledTaskRunner({
  +    frequency: Duration.fromObject({ minutes: 10 }),
  +    timeout: Duration.fromObject({ minutes: 15 }),
  +    initialDelay: Duration.fromObject({ seconds: 3 }),
  +  });

     indexBuilder.addCollator({
  -    defaultRefreshIntervalSeconds: 600,
  +    schedule,
       factory: DefaultCatalogCollatorFactory.fromConfig(env.config, {
        discovery: env.discovery,
        tokenManager: env.tokenManager,
       }),
     });

     indexBuilder.addCollator({
  -    defaultRefreshIntervalSeconds: 600,
  +    schedule,
       factory: DefaultTechDocsCollatorFactory.fromConfig(env.config, {
        discovery: env.discovery,
        tokenManager: env.tokenManager,
       }),
     });

     const { scheduler } = await indexBuilder.build();
  -  setTimeout(() => scheduler.start(), 3000);
  +  scheduler.start();
  /* ... */
  ```

  NOTE: For scenarios where the `lunr` search engine is used in a multi-node configuration, a non-distributed `TaskRunner` like the following should be implemented to ensure consistency across nodes (alternatively, you can configure
  the search plugin to use a non-distributed DB such as [SQLite](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/configuring-plugin-databases#postgresql-and-sqlite-3)):

  ```diff
  +import { TaskInvocationDefinition, TaskRunner } from '@backstage/backend-tasks';

  /* ... */

  +  const schedule: TaskRunner = {
  +    run: async (task: TaskInvocationDefinition) => {
  +      const startRefresh = async () => {
  +        while (!task.signal?.aborted) {
  +          try {
  +            await task.fn(task.signal);
  +          } catch {
  +            // ignore intentionally
  +          }
  +
  +          await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 600 * 1000));
  +        }
  +      };
  +      startRefresh();
  +    },
  +  };

     indexBuilder.addCollator({
  -    defaultRefreshIntervalSeconds: 600,
  +    schedule,
       factory: DefaultCatalogCollatorFactory.fromConfig(env.config, {
        discovery: env.discovery,
        tokenManager: env.tokenManager,
       }),
     });

  /* ... */
  ```

- 231fee736b: This backend now uses the `@backstage/backend-tasks` package facilities for scheduling fact retrievers.

  **BREAKING**: The `buildTechInsightsContext` function now takes an additional field in its options argument: `scheduler`. This is an instance of `PluginTaskScheduler`, which can be found in your backend initialization code's `env`.

  ```diff
   const builder = buildTechInsightsContext({
     logger: env.logger,
     config: env.config,
     database: env.database,
     discovery: env.discovery,

## @backstage/plugin-techdocs@1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ace749b785: TechDocs supports a new, experimental method of customization: addons!

  To customize the standalone TechDocs reader page experience, update your `/packages/app/src/App.tsx` in the following way:

  ```diff
  import { TechDocsIndexPage, TechDocsReaderPage } from '@backstage/plugin-techdocs';
  + import { TechDocsAddons } from '@backstage/plugin-techdocs-react';
  + import { SomeAddon } from '@backstage/plugin-some-plugin';

  // ...

      <Route path="/docs" element={<TechDocsIndexPage />} />
      <Route
        path="/docs/:namespace/:kind/:name/*"
        element={<TechDocsReaderPage />}
      >
  +      <TechDocsAddons>
  +        <SomeAddon />
  +      </TechDocsAddons>
      </Route>

  // ...
  ```

  To customize the TechDocs reader experience on the Catalog entity page, update your `packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx` in the following way:

  ```diff
  import { EntityTechdocsContent } from '@backstage/plugin-techdocs';
  + import { TechDocsAddons } from '@backstage/plugin-techdocs-react';
  + import { SomeAddon } from '@backstage/plugin-some-plugin';

  // ...

    <EntityLayoutWrapper>
      <EntityLayout.Route path="/" title="Overview">
        {overviewContent}
      </EntityLayout.Route>

      <EntityLayout.Route path="/docs" title="Docs">
  -      <EntityTechDocsContent />
  +      <EntityTechdocsContent>
  +        <TechDocsAddons>
  +          <SomeAddon />
  +        </TechDocsAddons>
  +      </EntityTechdocsContent>
      </EntityLayout.Route>
    </EntityLayoutWrapper>

  // ...
  ```

  If you do not wish to customize your TechDocs reader experience in this way at this time, no changes are necessary!

## @backstage/create-app@0.4.26

### Patch Changes

- 1691c6c5c2: Made `User` and `Group` entity kinds not permitted by the default
  `catalog.rules` config.

  The effect of this is that after creating a new Backstage repository, its
  catalog no longer permits regular users to register `User` or `Group` entities
  using the Backstage interface. Additionally, if you have config locations that
  result in `User` or `Group` entities, you need to add those kinds to its own
  specific rules:

  ```yaml
  catalog:
    locations:
      # This applies for example to url type locations
      - type: url
        target: https://example.com/org.yaml
        rules:
          - allow: [User, Group]
      # But also note that this applies to ALL org location types!
      - type: github-org
        target: https://github.com/my-org-name
        rules:
          - allow: [User, Group]
  ```

  This rule change does NOT affect entity providers, only things that are emitted
  by entity processors.

  We recommend that this change is applied to your own Backstage repository, since
  it makes it impossible for regular end users to affect your org data through
  e.g. YAML files. To do so, remove the two kinds from the default rules in your config:

  ```diff
   catalog:
     rules:
  -    - allow: [Component, System, API, Group, User, Resource, Location]
  +    - allow: [Component, System, API, Resource, Location]
  ```

  And for any location that in any way results in org data being ingested, add the corresponding rule to it:

  ```diff
   catalog:
     locations:
       - type: github-org
         target: https://github.com/my-org-name
  +      rules:
  +        - allow: [User, Group]
  ```

- 0e911394d2: Remove the `knex` package that is installed in the `packages/backend` as it's provided by the `@backstage/*` packages for you automatically. You can make the following change in your `packages/backend/package.json` if you wish to apply this change.

      "test": "backstage-cli package test",
      "clean": "backstage-cli package clean",

  ```

- 520e21aaea: imports `useSearch` hook from new `@backstage/plugin-search-react` package.

  To upgrade existing Apps:

  1.  Change the import to the following:

  `packages/app/src/components/search/SearchPage.tsx`

  ```diff
  import {
  ...
  SearchType,
  - useSearch,
  } from '@backstage/plugin-search';
  +import { useSearch } from '@backstage/plugin-search-react';
  ```

  2.  Add `@backstage/plugin-search-react` as a dependency to the app.

- 43759dd789: Removed `@octokit/rest` and `@gitbeaker/node` from backend dependencies as these are unused in the default app.

  To apply these changes to your existing app, remove the following lines from the `dependencies` section of `packages/backend/package.json`

  ```diff
       "@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend": "^1.0.0",
  -    "@gitbeaker/node": "^34.6.0",
  -    "@octokit/rest": "^18.5.3",
  ```

- e838a7060a: Add type resolutions for `@types/react` and `types/react-dom`.

  The reason for this is the usage of `"@types/react": "*"` as a dependency which is very common practice in react packages. This recently resolves to react 18 which introduces several breaking changes in both internal and external packages.

  To apply these changes to your existing installation, add a resolutions block to your `package.json`

  ```json
    "resolutions": {
      "@types/react": "^17",
      "@types/react-dom": "^17"
    },
  ```

  If your existing app depends on react 16, use this resolution block instead.

  ```json
    "resolutions": {
      "@types/react": "^16",
      "@types/react-dom": "^16"
    },
  ```

- 0a63e99a26: **BREAKING**: `IndexBuilder.addCollator()` now requires a `schedule` parameter (replacing `defaultRefreshIntervalSeconds`) which is expected to be a `TaskRunner` that is configured with the desired search indexing schedule for the given collator.

  `Scheduler.addToSchedule()` now takes a new parameter object (`ScheduleTaskParameters`) with two new options `id` and `scheduledRunner` in addition to the migrated `task` argument.

  NOTE: The search backend plugin now creates a dedicated database for coordinating indexing tasks.

  To make this change to an existing app, make the following changes to `packages/backend/src/plugins/search.ts`:

  ```diff
  +import { Duration } from 'luxon';

  /* ... */

  +  const schedule = env.scheduler.createScheduledTaskRunner({
  +    frequency: Duration.fromObject({ minutes: 10 }),
  +    timeout: Duration.fromObject({ minutes: 15 }),
  +    initialDelay: Duration.fromObject({ seconds: 3 }),
  +  });

     indexBuilder.addCollator({
  -    defaultRefreshIntervalSeconds: 600,
  +    schedule,
       factory: DefaultCatalogCollatorFactory.fromConfig(env.config, {
        discovery: env.discovery,
        tokenManager: env.tokenManager,
       }),
     });

     indexBuilder.addCollator({
  -    defaultRefreshIntervalSeconds: 600,
  +    schedule,
       factory: DefaultTechDocsCollatorFactory.fromConfig(env.config, {
        discovery: env.discovery,
        tokenManager: env.tokenManager,
       }),
     });

     const { scheduler } = await indexBuilder.build();
  -  setTimeout(() => scheduler.start(), 3000);
  +  scheduler.start();
  /* ... */
  ```

  NOTE: For scenarios where the `lunr` search engine is used in a multi-node configuration, a non-distributed `TaskRunner` like the following should be implemented to ensure consistency across nodes (alternatively, you can configure
  the search plugin to use a non-distributed DB such as [SQLite](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/configuring-plugin-databases#postgresql-and-sqlite-3)):

  ```diff
  +import { TaskInvocationDefinition, TaskRunner } from '@backstage/backend-tasks';

  /* ... */

  +  const schedule: TaskRunner = {
  +    run: async (task: TaskInvocationDefinition) => {
  +      const startRefresh = async () => {
  +        while (!task.signal?.aborted) {
  +          try {
  +            await task.fn(task.signal);
  +          } catch {
  +            // ignore intentionally
  +          }
  +
  +          await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 600 * 1000));
  +        }
  +      };
  +      startRefresh();
  +    },
  +  };

     indexBuilder.addCollator({
  -    defaultRefreshIntervalSeconds: 600,
  +    schedule,
       factory: DefaultCatalogCollatorFactory.fromConfig(env.config, {
        discovery: env.discovery,
        tokenManager: env.tokenManager,
       }),
     });

  /* ... */
  ```

## @backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-aws@0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 5969c4b65c: Add a new provider `AwsS3EntityProvider` as replacement for `AwsS3DiscoveryProcessor`.

  In order to migrate from the `AwsS3DiscoveryProcessor` you need to apply
  the following changes:

  **Before:**

  ```yaml
  # app-config.yaml

  catalog:
    locations:
      - type: s3-discovery
        target: https://sample-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prefix/
  ```

  ```ts
  /* packages/backend/src/plugins/catalog.ts */

  import { AwsS3DiscoveryProcessor } from '@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-aws';

  const builder = await CatalogBuilder.create(env);
  /** ... other processors ... */
  builder.addProcessor(new AwsS3DiscoveryProcessor(env.reader));
  ```

  **After:**

  ```yaml
  # app-config.yaml

  catalog:
    providers:
      awsS3:
        yourProviderId: # identifies your dataset / provider independent of config changes
          bucketName: sample-bucket
          prefix: prefix/ # optional
          region: us-east-2 # optional, uses the default region otherwise
  ```

  ```ts
  /* packages/backend/src/plugins/catalog.ts */

  import { AwsS3EntityProvider } from '@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-aws';

  const builder = await CatalogBuilder.create(env);
  /** ... other processors and/or providers ... */
  builder.addEntityProvider(
    ...AwsS3EntityProvider.fromConfig(env.config, {
      logger: env.logger,
      schedule: env.scheduler.createScheduledTaskRunner({
        frequency: Duration.fromObject({ minutes: 30 }),
        timeout: Duration.fromObject({ minutes: 3 }),
      }),
    }),
  );
  ```

  For simple setups, you can omit the provider ID at the config
  which has the same effect as using `default` for it.

  ```yaml
  # app-config.yaml

  catalog:
    providers:
      awsS3:
        # uses "default" as provider ID
        bucketName: sample-bucket
        prefix: prefix/ # optional
        region: us-east-2 # optional, uses the default region otherwise
  ```

    entityFilterKind={customEntityFilterKind}
    relationsType="aggregated"
  />
  ```

### Patch Changes

  - Introduce `IndexableResultSet` type, which wraps `IndexableDocument` instances in the same way as `SearchResultSet`.
