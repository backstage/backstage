These are the release notes for the v1.3.0 release of [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).

A huge thanks to the whole team of maintainers and contributors as well as the amazing Backstage Community for the hard work in getting this release developed and done.

## Highlights

### Scaffolder Dry Run and Template Editor

The scaffolder plugin now has a new template editor in addition to the form editor, which is accessible via the context menu on the top right hand corner of the Create page. It allows you to load a template from a local directory, edit it with a preview, execute it in dry-run mode, and view the results. Note that the [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) must be supported by your browser for this to be available.

### TypeScript 4.7

The recommended TypeScript version has been bumped to `~4.7.0`, and that’s what the main Backstage repository uses right now for its builds. Each Backstage project manages their version separately however, so there is no rush or immediate effect on users - you can update the `typescript` dependency in your root `package.json` once you feel ready to do so.

### Expiring Backend Tokens

In 1.2 we introduced expiry times for server-to-server authentication tokens issued from the standard `TokenManager`. At that point in time, the expiry was only added to tokens and not yet enforced. In this release however, it is now also enforced, meaning that expired tokens are considered invalid and will be rejected.

### Discovery providers

Several new [entity providers](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/life-of-an-entity) have been contributed as replacements for their corresponding discovery processors. Entity providers allow for more control and are [recommended](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/external-integrations) over their processing counterparts.
