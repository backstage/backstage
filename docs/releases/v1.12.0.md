These are the release notes for the v1.12.0 release of [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).

A huge thanks to the whole team of maintainers and contributors as well as the amazing Backstage Community for the hard work in getting this release developed and done.

## Highlights

This release mostly contains a bunch of smaller additions and bug fixes, but on top of that, thereâ€™s also some quality of life improvements and features as listed below. Enjoy!

### Using `zod` for action definitions

As a convenience, it is now possible to define your action inputs and outputs as `zod` schemas. This tends to be more convenient than writing JSON schema by hand, and gives you instant type feedback in your editor.

Added by [@zcason](https://github.com/zcason) in [#15561](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/15561)

### Reading paginated data from the catalog

The catalog has a new backend endpoint and corresponding client method, for fetching entities with proper cursor based pagination and server side filtering and ordering. This will be used to target performance hot-spots in the frontend and elsewhere.

Added by [@vinzscam](https://github.com/vinzscam) in [#12246](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/12246)

### Renamed backend system related plugin exports

As we settle the new backend system bit by bit, we have renamed a number of exports from individual plugins, to match the new [recommended naming patterns](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/architecture/naming-patterns). If you are already leveraging the new backend system, you may find that you need to update some imports. For example, `githubEntityProviderCatalogModule` was renamed to `catalogModuleGithubEntityProvider`. These were considered non-breaking since they are still in alpha. More details can be found in [#16760](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/16760) and [#16764](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/16764).

### New plugin: `catalog-backend` `puppetdb` module

Added a `catalogModulePuppetDbEntityProvider` alpha export for the new backend system. Contributed by [@tdabasinskas](https://github.com/tdabasinskas) in [#16184](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/16184)

### New plugin: Octopus deploy

[Octopus](https://octopus.com) deployment plugin. Contributed by [@jmezach](https://github.com/jmezach) in [#16353](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/16353)

### New plugin: StackStorm
