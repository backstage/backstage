These are the release notes for the v1.1.0 release of [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).

A huge thanks to the whole team of maintainers and contributors as well as the amazing Backstage Community for the hard work in getting this release developed and done.

## Highlights

### Auth

The auth [backend](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/auth-backend) and [node package](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/auth-node) received a few **BREAKING** changes.

You are now required to always return a `token` from the result of a sign-in resolver, and all default sign-in resolvers have been removed. This means that you will have to make a conscious choice to use one of a few predefined resolver functions to be able to use a given auth provider for signing in, or to write your own. Don’t worry, it’s actually rather straightforward to do, and ends up clarifying responsibilities for safe authentication and catalog ownership.

There are also a number of deprecations among the exported auth backend types, which you may want to adapt to.

For more information, see the relevant [documentation section](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/identity-resolver) about sign-in resolvers, and the [backend](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/auth-backend/CHANGELOG.md#0130)/[node](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/auth-node/CHANGELOG.md#020) changelogs.

### CLI

The [CLI](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/packages/cli) has bumped the `jest` version from `^26.0.1` to `^27.5.1`. You can find the complete list of breaking changes [here](https://github.com/facebook/jest/releases/tag/v27.0.0).

We strongly recommend having completed the [package role migration](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/package-role-migration) before upgrading to this version, as the package roles are used to automatically determine the testing environment for each package.

Note that one of the breaking changes of Jest 27 is that the `jsdom` environment no longer includes `setImmediate` and `clearImmediate`, which means you might need to update some of your frontend packages. Another notable change is that `jest.useFakeTimers` now defaults to the `'modern'` implementation, which also mocks microtasks.

### Kubernetes

The [Kubernetes backend](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/kubernetes-backend) has a **BREAKING** change, in that cluster suppliers now need to cache their results to allow frequent calls to their methods. This was done to pave the way for custom suppliers that dynamically fetch results from the real authority, instead of hard coding them in config. Thanks [@heyLu](https://github.com/heyLu)! ([#10428](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/10428))

### Permissions

The permission related packages received a number of **BREAKING** changes. Among other things, the names of types were settled to be made more crisp and clear. This will mostly apply to those who write custom permissions. This all goes to the [common](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/permission-common/CHANGELOG.md#060), [node](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/permission-node/CHANGELOG.md#060), and [react](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/permission-react/CHANGELOG.md#040) packages, whose changelogs are linked here.

### Stack Overflow

There’s a new Stack Overflow [frontend](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/stack-overflow) plugin with a corresponding [backend](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/stack-overflow-backend]!

### Misc

- The [CI/CD Statistics plugin](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/cicd-statistics) now has GitLab support, through the new [GitLab module](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/cicd-statistics-module-gitlab). Thanks [@djamaile](https://github.com/djamaile)! ([#10140](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/10140))

- The catalog [AWS module](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/catalog-backend-module-aws) added a new `AwsS3EntityProvider` as a replacement for the `AwsS3DiscoveryProcessor`. Thanks [@pjungermann](https://github.com/pjungermann)! ([#10480](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/10480))

- The permissions-related exports from the catalog backend have some [breaking changes](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/catalog-backend/CHANGELOG.md#110). These are all in alpha still, so this only applies to you if you are developing catalog permissions and import from `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend/alpha`.
