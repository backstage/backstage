# Release v1.9.0

## @backstage/backend-common@0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- de8a975911: Changed to use native `AbortController` and `AbortSignal` from Node.js, instead
  of the one from `node-abort-controller`. This is possible now that the minimum
  supported Node.js version of the project is 16.

  Note that their interfaces are very slightly different, but typically not in a
  way that matters to consumers. If you see any typescript errors as a direct
  result from this, they are compatible with each other in the ways that we
  interact with them, and should be possible to type-cast across without ill
  effects.

## @backstage/catalog-client@1.2.0

### Minor Changes

  - @backstage/errors@1.1.4
  - @backstage/catalog-model@1.1.4

## @backstage/cli@0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 736f893f72: The Jest configuration that was previously enabled with `BACKSTAGE_NEXT_TESTS` is now enabled by default. To revert to the old configuration you can now instead set `BACKSTAGE_OLD_TESTS`.

  This new configuration uses the `babel` coverage provider rather than `v8`. It used to be that `v8` worked better when using Sucrase for transpilation, but now that we have switched to SWC, `babel` seems to work better. In addition, the new configuration also enables source maps by default, as they no longer have a negative impact on code coverage accuracy, and it also enables a modified Jest runtime with additional caching of script objects.

### Patch Changes

- 91d050c140: changed tests created by create-plugin to follow eslint-rules best practices particularly testing-library/prefer-screen-queries and testing-library/render-result-naming-convention
- 43b2b9c791: Removed the unused dependency on `@sucrase/jest-plugin`.
- dd721148b5: Updated Jest coverage configuration to only apply either in the root project or package configuration, depending on whether repo or package tests are run.
- 5850ef9b84: Fix webpack dev server issue where it wasn't serving `index.html` from correct endpoint on subsequent requests.

  - @backstage/config@1.0.5

## @backstage/core-app-api@1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e0d9c9559a: Added a new `AppRouter` component and `app.createRoot()` method that replaces `app.getRouter()` and `app.getProvider()`, which are now deprecated. The new `AppRouter` component is a drop-in replacement for the old router component, while the new `app.createRoot()` method is used instead of the old provider component.

  An old app setup might look like this:

  ```tsx
  const app = createApp(/* ... */);

  const AppProvider = app.getProvider();
  const AppRouter = app.getRouter();

  const routes = ...;

  const App = () => (
    <AppProvider>
      <AlertDisplay />
      <OAuthRequestDialog />
      <AppRouter>
        <Root>{routes}</Root>
      </AppRouter>
    </AppProvider>
  );

  export default App;
  ```

  With these new APIs, the setup now looks like this:

  ```tsx
  import { AppRouter } from '@backstage/core-app-api';

  const app = createApp(/* ... */);

  const routes = ...;

  export default app.createRoot(
    <>
      <AlertDisplay />
      <OAuthRequestDialog />
      <AppRouter>
        <Root>{routes}</Root>
      </AppRouter>
    </>,
  );
  ```

  Note that `app.createRoot()` accepts a React element, rather than a component.

### Patch Changes

- 6870b43dd1: Fix for the automatic rewriting of base URLs.
- 203271b746: Prevent duplicate feature flag components from rendering in the settings when using <FeatureFlagged /> components

- 653d7912ac: Made `WebStorage` notify its subscribers when `localStorage` values change in other tabs/windows
- 63310e3987: Apps will now rewrite the `app.baseUrl` configuration to match the current `location.origin`. The `backend.baseUrl` will also be rewritten in the same way when the `app.baseUrl` and `backend.baseUrl` have matching origins. This will reduce the need for separate frontend builds for different environments.

## @backstage/core-plugin-api@1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9a1864976a: Added a new `display` property to the `AlertMessage` which can accept the values `permanent` or `transient`.

  Here's a rough example of how to trigger an alert using the new `display` property:

  ```ts
  import { alertApiRef, useApi } from '@backstage/core-plugin-api';

  const ExampleTransient = () => {
    const alertApi = useApi(alertApiRef);
    alertApi.post({
      message: 'Example of Transient Alert',
      severity: 'success',
      display: 'transient',
    });
  };
  ```

## @backstage/plugin-catalog-backend@1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 16891a212c: Added new `POST /entities/by-refs` endpoint, which allows you to efficiently
  batch-fetch entities by their entity ref. This can be useful e.g. in graphql
  resolvers or similar contexts where you need to fetch many entities at the same
  time.

- 273ba3a77f: Deprecated Prometheus metrics in favour of OpenTelemtry metrics.

- c395abb5b2: The catalog no longer stops after the first processor `validateEntityKind`
  method returns `true` when validating entity kind shapes. Instead, it continues
  through all registered processors that have this method, and requires that _at
  least one_ of them returned true.

  The old behavior of stopping early made it harder to extend existing core kinds
  with additional fields, since the `BuiltinKindsEntityProcessor` is always
  present at the top of the processing chain and ensures that your additional
  validation code would never be run.

  This is technically a breaking change, although it should not affect anybody
  under normal circumstances, except if you had problematic validation code that
  you were unaware that it was not being run. That code may now start to exhibit
  those problems.

  If you need to disable this new behavior, `CatalogBuilder` as used in your
  `packages/backend/src/plugins/catalog.ts` file now has a
  `useLegacySingleProcessorValidation()` method to go back to the old behavior.

  ```diff
   const builder = await CatalogBuilder.create(env);
  +builder.useLegacySingleProcessorValidation();
  ```

- 3072ebfdd7: The search table also holds the original entity value now and the facets endpoint fetches the filtered entity data from the search table.

### Patch Changes

- ba13ff663c: Added a new `catalog.rules[].location` configuration that makes it possible to configure catalog rules to only apply to specific locations, either via exact match or a glob pattern.
- d8593ce0e6: Do not use deprecated `LocationSpec` from the `@backstage/plugin-catalog-node` package
- c507aee8a2: Ensured typescript type checks in migration files.

- b05dcd5530: Move the `zod` dependency to a version that does not collide with other libraries
- 5b3e2afa45: Fixed deprecated use of `substr` into `substring`.
- 71147d5c16: Internal code reorganization.
- 93870e4df1: Track the last time the final entity changed with new timestamp "last updated at" data in final entities database, which gets updated with the time when final entity is updated.

## @backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-incremental-ingestion@0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 98c643a1a2: Introduces incremental entity providers, which are used for streaming very large data sources into the catalog.

### Patch Changes

- c507aee8a2: Ensured typescript type checks in migration files.

- 884d749b14: Refactored to use `coreServices` from `@backstage/backend-plugin-api`.

- de8a975911: Changed to use native `AbortController` and `AbortSignal` from Node.js, instead
  of the one from `node-abort-controller`. This is possible now that the minimum
  supported Node.js version of the project is 16.

  Note that their interfaces are very slightly different, but typically not in a
  way that matters to consumers. If you see any typescript errors as a direct
  result from this, they are compatible with each other in the ways that we
  interact with them, and should be possible to type-cast across without ill
  effects.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/backend-plugin-api@0.2.0

## @backstage/plugin-kubernetes-backend@0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 2db8acffe7: Kubernetes plugin now gracefully surfaces transport-level errors (like DNS or timeout, or other socket errors) occurring while fetching data. This will be merged into any data that is fetched successfully, fixing a bug where the whole page would be empty if any fetch operation encountered such an error.

### Patch Changes

- 22e20b3a59: Clusters declared in the app-config can now have their CA configured via a local filesystem path using the `caFile` property.
- 9ce7866ecd: Updated dependency `@kubernetes/client-node` to `0.18.0`.

## @backstage/plugin-scaffolder@1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- ddd1c3308d: Implement Custom Field Explorer to view and play around with available installed custom field extensions
- adb1b01e32: Adds the ability to supply a `transformErrors` function to the `Stepper` for `/next`
- 34a48cdc4f: The `RepoUrlPicker` field extension now has an `allowedProjects` option for narrowing the selection of Bitbucket URLs.

### Patch Changes

- d4d07cf55e: Enabling the customization of the last step in the scaffolder template.

  To override the content you have to do the next:

  ```typescript jsx
  <TemplatePage ReviewStepComponent={YourCustomComponent} />
  ```

- ef803022f1: Initialize all `formData` in the `Stepper` in `/next`

- 9b1fadf6d8: Added `noHtml5Validate` prop to `FormProps` on `NextScaffolderPage`

- b05dcd5530: Move the `zod` dependency to a version that does not collide with other libraries

- 2e701b3796: Internal refactor to use `react-router-dom` rather than `react-router`.

- 9000952e87: Form data is now passed to validator functions in 'next' scaffolder, so it's now possible to perform validation for fields that depend on other field values. This is something that we discourage due to the coupling that it creates, but is sometimes still the most sensible solution.

  ```typescript jsx
  export const myCustomValidation = (
    value: string,
    validation: FieldValidation,
    { apiHolder, formData }: { apiHolder: ApiHolder; formData: JsonObject },
  ) => {
    // validate
  };

## @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend@1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- a20a0ea698: Added `requiredConversationResolution` template option to `github:repo:create`, `github:repo:push` and `publish:github`

- b32005e98a: Deprecated the `taskWorkers` option in RouterOptions in favor of `concurrentTasksLimit` which sets the limit of concurrent tasks in a single TaskWorker

  TaskWorker can now run multiple (defaults to 10) tasks concurrently using the `concurrentTasksLimit` option available in both `RouterOptions` and `CreateWorkerOptions`.

  To use the option to create a TaskWorker:

  ```diff
  const worker = await TaskWorker.create({
      taskBroker,
      actionRegistry,
      integrations,
      logger,
      workingDirectory,
      additionalTemplateFilters,
  +   concurrentTasksLimit: 10 // (1 to Infinity)
  });
  ```

### Minor Changes

- 29ebc43a0b: numberOfResults is now provided alongside the query result
- dff9843718: The search engine now better handles the case when it receives 0 documents at index-time. Prior to this change, the indexer would replace any existing index with an empty index, effectively deleting it. Now instead, a warning is logged, and any existing index is left alone (preserving the index from the last successful indexing attempt).
- d09485ea79: Added support for self hosted OpenSearch via new provider

### Patch Changes

  ```diff
  const searchEngine = await PgSearchEngine.fromConfig(env.config, {
    database: env.database,
  + logger: env.logger,
  });
  ```

- dff9843718: The search engine now better handles the case when it receives 0 documents at index-time.

### Patch Changes

- a962ce0551: Wait for indexer initialization before finalizing indexing.

- de8a975911: Changed to use native `AbortController` and `AbortSignal` from Node.js, instead
  of the one from `node-abort-controller`. This is possible now that the minimum
  supported Node.js version of the project is 16.

  Note that their interfaces are very slightly different, but typically not in a
  way that matters to consumers. If you see any typescript errors as a direct
  result from this, they are compatible with each other in the ways that we
  interact with them, and should be possible to type-cast across without ill
  effects.

- 683ced83f6: Fixed a bug that could cause a `max listeners exceeded warning` to be logged when more than 10 collators were running simultaneously.

- 81b1e7b0fe: Updated indexer and decorator base classes to take advantage of features introduced in Node.js v16; be sure you are running a [supported version of Node.js](https://backstage.io/docs/releases/v1.8.0#node-16-and-18).

- 54c5836f7a: Use of `TestPipeline.withSubject()` is now deprecated. Instead, use the `fromCollator`, `fromDecorator`, or `fromIndexer` static methods to instantiate a test pipeline. You may also use the class' `withCollator`, `withDecorator`, and `withIndexer` instance methods to build test pipelines that consist of multiple test subjects.

## @backstage/plugin-sonarqube@0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 6b59903bfa: Parts of plugin-sonarqube have been moved into a new plugin-sonarqube-react package. Additionally some types that were
  previously internal to plugin-sonarqube have been made public and will allow access for third-parties. As the sonarqube
  plugin has not yet reached 1.0 breaking changes are expected in the future. As such exports of plugin-sonarqube-react
  require importing via the `/alpha` entrypoint:

  ```ts
  import { sonarQubeApiRef } from '@backstage/plugin-sonarqube-react/alpha';

  const sonarQubeApi = useApi(sonarQubeApiRef);
  ```

- ea4a5be8f3: Create a variable for minimum height and add a prop named 'fit' for determining if the graph height should grow or be contained.

- 2e701b3796: Internal refactor to use `react-router-dom` rather than `react-router`.

- d2e3bf6737: Made AlertDisplay not crash on undefined messages

- 64a579a998: Add items prop to SupportButton. This prop can be used to override the items that would otherwise be grabbed from the config.

- 5d3058355d: Add `react/forbid-elements` linter rule for button, suggest MUI `Button`

- 3280711113: Updated dependency `msw` to `^0.49.0`.

- 19356df560: Updated dependency `zen-observable` to `^0.9.0`.

- 8015ff1258: Tweaked wording to use inclusive terminology

- 830687539f: Sync components in @backstage/core-components with the Component Design Guidelines

- 1ae86ab5fb: Added an option to allow the `AlertMessage` to be self-closing. This is done with a new `display` property that is set to `transient` on the `AlertMessage` when triggering a message to the `AlertApi`. The length of time that these transient messages stay open for can be set using the `transientTimeoutMs` prop on the `AlertDisplay` in the `App.tsx`. Here is an example:

  ```diff
    const App = () => (
      <AppProvider>
  +     <AlertDisplay transientTimeoutMs={2500} />
        <OAuthRequestDialog />
        <AppRouter>
          <Root>{routes}</Root>
        </AppRouter>
      </AppProvider>
    );
  ```

  The above example will set the transient timeout to 2500ms from the default of 5000ms

- 16e31e690f: InfoCard - Remove subheader container when there is not a subheader or icon

- a5a2d12298: Added option to pass additional headers to `<ProxiedSignInPage />`, which are passed along with the request to the underlying provider

  - @backstage/errors@1.1.4
  - @backstage/config@1.0.5
  - @backstage/theme@0.2.16

## @backstage/create-app@0.4.35

### Patch Changes

- c4788dbb58: Fix dependency ordering in templated packages.

- 83d3167594: Bumped create-app version.

- 2cb6963f9b: Bumped create-app version.

- 6465ab3686: Bumped create-app version.

- af1358bb07: added default project name for CI job compatibility

- 935b66a646: Change step output template examples to use square bracket syntax.

- dfb269fab2: Updated the template to have the `'/test'` proxy endpoint in `app-config.yaml` be commented out by default.

- d9b3753f87: Updated the app template to use the new `AppRouter` component instead of `app.getRouter()`, as well as `app.createRoot()` instead of `app.getProvider()`.

  To apply this change to an existing app, make the following change to `packages/app/src/App.tsx`:

  ```diff
  -import { FlatRoutes } from '@backstage/core-app-api';
  +import { AppRouter, FlatRoutes } from '@backstage/core-app-api';

   ...

  -const AppProvider = app.getProvider();
  -const AppRouter = app.getRouter();

   ...

  -const App = () => (
  +export default app.createRoot(
  -  <AppProvider>
  +  <>
       <AlertDisplay />
       <OAuthRequestDialog />
       <AppRouter>
         <Root>{routes}</Root>
       </AppRouter>
  -  </AppProvider>
  +  </>,
   );
  ```

  The final export step should end up looking something like this:

  ```tsx
  export default app.createRoot(
    <>
      <AlertDisplay />
      <OAuthRequestDialog />
      <AppRouter>
        <Root>{routes}</Root>
      </AppRouter>
    </>,
  );
  ```

  Note that `app.createRoot()` accepts a React element, rather than a component.

- 71e75c0b70: Removed the `react-router` dependency from the app package, using only `react-router-dom` instead.

  This change is just a bit of cleanup and is optional. If you want to apply it to your app, remove the `react-router` dependency from `packages/app/package.json`, and replace any imports from `react-router` with `react-router-dom` instead.

### Patch Changes

- c8f49ed4d0: Update search links to only have header as linkable text

- 2e701b3796: Internal refactor to use `react-router-dom` rather than `react-router`.

- ea4a5be8f3: Adds styling to graph forcing it to always fill out the available space.

- 3280711113: Updated dependency `msw` to `^0.49.0`.

- 4dec6f16be: Added new `@backstage/plugin-explore-backend` & `@backstage/plugin-explore-common` packages.

  This deprecates the `ExploreToolsConfig` API (in `@backstage/plugin-explore-react`) which is replaced by the `ExploreApi` & `ExploreClient`. The list of `ExploreTool` data can now be provided on the backend by either using the supplied `StaticExploreToolProvider` or by implementing a custom `ExploreToolProvider`. See the [explore-backend README](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/explore-backend/README.md) for full details.

  NOTE: Existing installations that have customized the `ExploreToolConfig` will continue to work through the new `ExploreClient`. However, existing data should be migrated over to new `explore-backend` plugin as `ExploreToolConfig` will be removed in the future.

  BREAKING CHANGE: If you have previously installed the `explore` plugin, but not yet customized the `ExploreToolConfig` API in your `packages/app`, this will result in an empty list of tools.
