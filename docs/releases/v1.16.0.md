These are the release notes for the v1.16.0 release of [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).

A huge thanks to the whole team of maintainers and contributors as well as the amazing Backstage Community for their hard work in getting this release developed and done. A little smaller release this time with the Summer Holidays, hope you’re all having some deserved time off also!

## Highlights

### Continued support for Material-UI V5

There have been some more tweaks here or there to types and the theme system to ensure a smooth future migration toward Material-UI version 5. This should be mostly transparent to adopters, but please let us know if you encounter any oddities around the theme system after upgrading to this release.

### **BREAKING**: `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-incremental-ingestion`

Incremental event handlers are now async by default, and their response shape has been changed to allow further extension.

Instead of returning `null` or `undefined` from an event handler to indicate no-oop, instead return the value `{ type: "ignored" }`.

Contributed by [@cowboyd](https://github.com/cowboyd) in [#18216](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/18216)

### **BREAKING**: `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-confluence-to-markdown`

The configuration has been changed and the authentication property of `confluence.auth` is now an `object` instead to allow further evolution.

Contributed by [@jsundquist](https://github.com/jsundquist) in [#18583](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/18583)

### `@backstage/plugin-lighthouse`

Added more verbose component for when no audits for a website corresponding to the provided url were found.

Contributed by [@Zaperex](https://github.com/Zaperex) in [#18399](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/18399)

### `@backstage/plugin-home`

A reference to material-ui’s dependency has been updated from `@rjsf/material-ui` to `@rjsf/material-ui-v5`.

Contributed by [@mario-mui](https://github.com/mario-mui) in [#18432](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/18432)

It is now possible to customize the settings widget for different properties by using the`uiSchema` property.
