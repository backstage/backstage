Upgrade Helper: [https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper/?to=1.31.0-next.0](https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper/?to=1.31.0-next.0)

## @backstage/backend-app-api@0.10.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- 19ff127: **BREAKING**: The deprecated `identityServiceFactory` and `tokenManagerServiceFactory` have been removed.
- d425fc4: **BREAKING**: The return values from `createBackendPlugin`, `createBackendModule`, and `createServiceFactory` are now simply `BackendFeature` and `ServiceFactory`, instead of the previously deprecated form of a function that returns them. For this reason, `createServiceFactory` also no longer accepts the callback form where you provide direct options to the service. This also affects all `coreServices.*` service refs.

  This may in particular affect tests; if you were effectively doing `createBackendModule({...})()` (note the parentheses), you can now remove those extra parentheses at the end. You may encounter cases of this in your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` too, where you add plugins, modules, and services. If you were using `createServiceFactory` with a function as its argument for the purpose of passing in options, this pattern has been deprecated for a while and is no longer supported. You may want to explore the new multiton patterns to achieve your goals, or moving settings to app-config.

  As part of this change, the `IdentityFactoryOptions` type was removed, and can no longer be used to tweak that service. The identity service was also deprecated some time ago, and you will want to [migrate to the new auth system](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/auth-service-migration) if you still rely on it.

### Patch Changes

- 8ba77ed: The `legacyPlugin` and `makeLegacyPlugin` helpers now provide their own shim implementation of the identity and token manager services, as these services are being removed from the new backend system.

## @backstage/backend-defaults@0.5.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- 359fcd7: **BREAKING**: The backwards compatibility with plugins using legacy auth through the token manager service has been removed. This means that instead of falling back to using the old token manager, requests towards plugins that don't support the new auth system will simply fail. Please make sure that all plugins in your deployment are hosted within a backend instance from the new backend system.

- d425fc4: **BREAKING**: The return values from `createBackendPlugin`, `createBackendModule`, and `createServiceFactory` are now simply `BackendFeature` and `ServiceFactory`, instead of the previously deprecated form of a function that returns them. For this reason, `createServiceFactory` also no longer accepts the callback form where you provide direct options to the service. This also affects all `coreServices.*` service refs.

  This may in particular affect tests; if you were effectively doing `createBackendModule({...})()` (note the parentheses), you can now remove those extra parentheses at the end. You may encounter cases of this in your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` too, where you add plugins, modules, and services. If you were using `createServiceFactory` with a function as its argument for the purpose of passing in options, this pattern has been deprecated for a while and is no longer supported. You may want to explore the new multiton patterns to achieve your goals, or moving settings to app-config.

  As part of this change, the `IdentityFactoryOptions` type was removed, and can no longer be used to tweak that service. The identity service was also deprecated some time ago, and you will want to [migrate to the new auth system](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/auth-service-migration) if you still rely on it.

- 19ff127: **BREAKING**: The default backend instance no longer provides implementations for the identity and token manager services, which have been removed from `@backstage/backend-plugin-api`.

  If you rely on plugins that still require these services, you can add them to your own backend by re-creating the service reference and factory.

  The following can be used to implement the identity service:

  ```ts
  import {
    coreServices,
    createServiceFactory,
    createServiceRef,
  } from '@backstage/backend-plugin-api';
  import {
    DefaultIdentityClient,
    IdentityApi,
  } from '@backstage/plugin-auth-node';

  backend.add(
    createServiceFactory({
      service: createServiceRef<IdentityApi>({ id: 'core.identity' }),
      deps: {
        discovery: coreServices.discovery,
      },
      async factory({ discovery }) {
        return DefaultIdentityClient.create({ discovery });
      },
    }),
  );
  ```

  The following can be used to implement the token manager service:

  ```ts
  import { ServerTokenManager, TokenManager } from '@backstage/backend-common';
  import { createBackend } from '@backstage/backend-defaults';
  import {
    coreServices,
    createServiceFactory,
    createServiceRef,
  } from '@backstage/backend-plugin-api';

  backend.add(
    createServiceFactory({
      service: createServiceRef<TokenManager>({ id: 'core.tokenManager' }),
      deps: {
        config: coreServices.rootConfig,
        logger: coreServices.rootLogger,
      },
      createRootContext({ config, logger }) {
        return ServerTokenManager.fromConfig(config, {
          logger,
          allowDisabledTokenManager: true,
        });
      },
      async factory(_deps, tokenManager) {
        return tokenManager;
      },
    }),
  );
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 7f779c7: `auth.externalAccess` should be optional in the config schema

- 7a72ec8: Exports the `discoveryFeatureLoader` as a replacement for the deprecated `featureDiscoveryService`.
  The `discoveryFeatureLoader` is a new backend system [feature loader](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/architecture/feature-loaders/) that discovers backend features from the current `package.json` and its dependencies.
  Here is an example using the `discoveryFeatureLoader` loader in a new backend instance:

  ```ts
  import { createBackend } from '@backstage/backend-defaults';
  import { discoveryFeatureLoader } from '@backstage/backend-defaults';
  //...

  const backend = createBackend();
  //...
  backend.add(discoveryFeatureLoader);
  //...
  backend.start();
  ```

- 66dbf0a: Allow the cache service to accept the human duration format for TTL

- 5a8fcb4: Added the option to skip database migrations by setting `skipMigrations: true` in config. This can be done globally in the database config or by plugin id.

- 0b2a402: Updates to the config schema to match reality

- Updated dependencies

  - @backstage/types@1.1.1

## @backstage/backend-dynamic-feature-service@0.4.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- 9080f57: **BREAKING**: `dynamicPluginsServiceFactory` is no longer callable as a function. If you need to provide options to make a custom factory, use `dynamicPluginsSchemasServiceFactoryWithOptions` instead.

### Patch Changes

- cd38da8: Deprecate the `dynamicPluginsServiceRef`, `dynamicPluginsServiceFactory` and `dynamicPluginsServiceFactoryWithOptions` in favor of using the `dynamicPluginsFeatureDiscoveryLoader` to discover dynamic features in a new backend system.

  See usage examples below:

  Example using the `dynamicPluginsFeatureDiscoveryLoader` loader in a backend instance:

  ```ts
  import { createBackend } from '@backstage/backend-defaults';
  import { dynamicPluginsFeatureDiscoveryLoader } from '@backstage/backend-dynamic-feature-service';
  //...

  const backend = createBackend();
  backend.add(dynamicPluginsFeatureDiscoveryLoader);
  //...
  backend.start();
  ```

  Passing options to the `dynamicPluginsFeatureDiscoveryLoader` loader in a backend instance:

  ```ts
  import { createBackend } from '@backstage/backend-defaults';
  import { dynamicPluginsFeatureDiscoveryLoader } from '@backstage/backend-dynamic-feature-service';
  import { myCustomModuleLoader } from './myCustomModuleLoader';
  //...

  const backend = createBackend();
  backend.add(
    dynamicPluginsFeatureDiscoveryLoader({
      moduleLoader: myCustomModuleLoader,
    }),
  );
  //...
  backend.start();
  ```

- e27f889: Relax type check for a plugin's default export to also accept a BackendFeature defined as a function instead of an object

- d425fc4: Modules, plugins, and services are now `BackendFeature`, not a function that returns a feature.

## @backstage/backend-plugin-api@0.9.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- 19ff127: **BREAKING**: The deprecated identity and token manager services have been removed. This means that `coreServices.identity` and `coreServices.tokenManager` are gone, along with related types and utilities in other packages.

- f687050: Removed the following deprecated exports

  - `BackendPluginConfig` use `CreateBackendPluginOptions`
  - `BackendModuleConfig` use `CreateBackendModuleOptions`
  - `ExtensionPointConfig` use `CreateExtensionPointOptions`

- 4d82481: Removed deprecated `ServiceFactoryOrFunction` type.

- d425fc4: **BREAKING**: The return values from `createBackendPlugin`, `createBackendModule`, and `createServiceFactory` are now simply `BackendFeature` and `ServiceFactory`, instead of the previously deprecated form of a function that returns them. For this reason, `createServiceFactory` also no longer accepts the callback form where you provide direct options to the service. This also affects all `coreServices.*` service refs.

  This may in particular affect tests; if you were effectively doing `createBackendModule({...})()` (note the parentheses), you can now remove those extra parentheses at the end. You may encounter cases of this in your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` too, where you add plugins, modules, and services.

### Minor Changes

- 19ff127: **BREAKING**: Removed service mocks for the identity and token manager services, which have been removed from `@backstage/backend-plugin-api`.
- d425fc4: **BREAKING**: The return values from `createBackendPlugin`, `createBackendModule`, and `createServiceFactory` are now simply `BackendFeature` and `ServiceFactory`, instead of the previously deprecated form of a function that returns them.

## @backstage/frontend-app-api@0.9.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- 62cce6c: Removed deprecated `icons` property passing to `createApp` and `createSpecializedApp`. Use `IconBundleBlueprint.make` to create extensions instead and include them in the app.

### Patch Changes

- fec8b57: Updated exports to use the new type parameters for extensions and extension blueprints.

- 2bb9517: Introduce the `@backstage/plugin-app` package to hold all of the built-in extensions for easy consumption and overriding.

- f3a2b91: Moved several implementations of built-in APIs from being hardcoded in the app to instead be provided as API extensions. This moves all API-related inputs from the `app` extension to the respective API extensions. For example, extensions created with `ThemeBlueprint` are now attached to the `themes` input of `api:app-theme` rather than the `app` extension.

- 5446061: Internal refactor following removal of v1 extension support. The app implementation itself still supports v1 extensions at runtime.

- 98850de: Added support for defining `replaces` in `createExtensionInput` which will allow extensions to redirect missing `attachTo` points to an input of the created extension.

  ```ts
  export const AppThemeApi = ApiBlueprint.makeWithOverrides({
    name: 'app-theme',
    inputs: {
      themes: createExtensionInput([ThemeBlueprint.dataRefs.theme], {
        // attachTo: { id: 'app', input: 'themes'} will be redirected to this input instead
        replaces: [{ id: 'app', input: 'themes' }],
      }),
    },
    factory: () {
      ...
    }
  });
  ```

- 4a66456: Added the `root` extension the replace the `app` extension as the root of the app.

- Updated dependencies

  - @backstage/plugin-app@0.1.0-next.0

  - @backstage/version-bridge@1.0.8

## @backstage/frontend-plugin-api@0.8.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- 5446061: **BREAKING**: Removed support for "v1" extensions. This means that it is no longer possible to declare inputs and outputs as objects when using `createExtension`. In addition, all extension creators except for `createComponentExtension` have been removed, use the equivalent blueprint instead. See the [1.30 migration documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/frontend-system/architecture/migrations/#130) for more information on this change.
- fec8b57: **BREAKING**: Updated the type parameters for `ExtensionDefinition` and `ExtensionBlueprint` to only have a single object parameter. The base type parameter is exported as `ExtensionDefinitionParameters` and `ExtensionBlueprintParameters` respectively. This is shipped as an immediate breaking change as we expect usage of these types to be rare, and it does not affect the runtime behavior of the API.

  This is a breaking change as it changes the type parameters. Existing usage can generally be updated as follows:

  - `ExtensionDefinition<any>` -> `ExtensionDefinition`
  - `ExtensionDefinition<any, any>` -> `ExtensionDefinition`
  - `ExtensionDefinition<TConfig>` -> `ExtensionDefinition<{ config: TConfig }>`
  - `ExtensionDefinition<TConfig, TConfigInput>` -> `ExtensionDefinition<{ config: TConfig, configInput: TConfigInput }>`

  If you need to infer the parameter you can use `ExtensionDefinitionParameters`, for example:

  ```ts
  import {
    ExtensionDefinition,
    ExtensionDefinitionParameters,
  } from '@backstage/frontend-plugin-api';

  function myUtility<T extends ExtensionDefinitionParameters>(
    ext: ExtensionDefinition<T>,
  ): T['config'] {
    // ...
  }
  ```

  The same patterns apply to `ExtensionBlueprint`.

  This change is made to improve the readability of API references and ability to evolve the type parameters in the future.

### Patch Changes

- 2bb9517: Introduce the `@backstage/plugin-app` package to hold all of the built-in extensions for easy consumption and overriding.

- f3a2b91: Moved several implementations of built-in APIs from being hardcoded in the app to instead be provided as API extensions.

- 98850de: Added support for defining `replaces` in `createExtensionInput` which will allow extensions to redirect missing `attachTo` points to an input of the created extension.

  ```ts
  export const AppThemeApi = ApiBlueprint.makeWithOverrides({
    name: 'app-theme',
    inputs: {
      themes: createExtensionInput([ThemeBlueprint.dataRefs.theme], {
        // attachTo: { id: 'app', input: 'themes'} will be redirected to this input instead
        replaces: [{ id: 'app', input: 'themes' }],
      }),
    },
    factory: () {
      ...
    }
  });
  ```

- 4a66456: A new `apis` parameter has been added to `factory` for extensions. This is a way to access utility APIs without being coupled to the React context.

## @backstage/plugin-auth-backend-module-atlassian-provider@0.3.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- d425fc4: **BREAKING**: The return values from `createBackendPlugin`, `createBackendModule`, and `createServiceFactory` are now simply `BackendFeature` and `ServiceFactory`, instead of the previously deprecated form of a function that returns them. For this reason, `createServiceFactory` also no longer accepts the callback form where you provide direct options to the service. This also affects all `coreServices.*` service refs.

  This may in particular affect tests; if you were effectively doing `createBackendModule({...})()` (note the parentheses), you can now remove those extra parentheses at the end. You may encounter cases of this in your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` too, where you add plugins, modules, and services. If you were using `createServiceFactory` with a function as its argument for the purpose of passing in options, this pattern has been deprecated for a while and is no longer supported. You may want to explore the new multiton patterns to achieve your goals, or moving settings to app-config.

  As part of this change, the `IdentityFactoryOptions` type was removed, and can no longer be used to tweak that service. The identity service was also deprecated some time ago, and you will want to [migrate to the new auth system](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/auth-service-migration) if you still rely on it.

## @backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-backstage-openapi@0.4.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- d425fc4: **BREAKING**: The return values from `createBackendPlugin`, `createBackendModule`, and `createServiceFactory` are now simply `BackendFeature` and `ServiceFactory`, instead of the previously deprecated form of a function that returns them. For this reason, `createServiceFactory` also no longer accepts the callback form where you provide direct options to the service. This also affects all `coreServices.*` service refs.

  This may in particular affect tests; if you were effectively doing `createBackendModule({...})()` (note the parentheses), you can now remove those extra parentheses at the end. You may encounter cases of this in your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` too, where you add plugins, modules, and services. If you were using `createServiceFactory` with a function as its argument for the purpose of passing in options, this pattern has been deprecated for a while and is no longer supported. You may want to explore the new multiton patterns to achieve your goals, or moving settings to app-config.

  As part of this change, the `IdentityFactoryOptions` type was removed, and can no longer be used to tweak that service. The identity service was also deprecated some time ago, and you will want to [migrate to the new auth system](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/auth-service-migration) if you still rely on it.

## @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-bitbucket@0.3.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- d425fc4: **BREAKING**: The return values from `createBackendPlugin`, `createBackendModule`, and `createServiceFactory` are now simply `BackendFeature` and `ServiceFactory`, instead of the previously deprecated form of a function that returns them. For this reason, `createServiceFactory` also no longer accepts the callback form where you provide direct options to the service. This also affects all `coreServices.*` service refs.

  This may in particular affect tests; if you were effectively doing `createBackendModule({...})()` (note the parentheses), you can now remove those extra parentheses at the end. You may encounter cases of this in your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` too, where you add plugins, modules, and services. If you were using `createServiceFactory` with a function as its argument for the purpose of passing in options, this pattern has been deprecated for a while and is no longer supported.

You may encounter cases of this in your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` too, where you add plugins, modules, and services. If you were using `createServiceFactory` with a function as its argument for the purpose of passing in options, this pattern has been deprecated for a while and is no longer supported. You may want to explore the new multiton patterns to achieve your goals, or moving settings to app-config.

  As part of this change, the `IdentityFactoryOptions` type was removed, and can no longer be used to tweak that service. The identity service was also deprecated some time ago, and you will want to [migrate to the new auth system](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/auth-service-migration) if you still rely on it.

### Patch Changes

- 3ec5ccb: The `createRouter` and its related types has been marked as deprecared. This backend should instead be initialized using the new backend system.
- 19ff127: Internal refactor to remove dependencies on the identity and token manager services, which have been removed. Public APIs no longer require the identity service or token manager to be provided.

### Patch Changes

- 5add8e1: Added a `SignalsDisplay` extension to allows the signals plugin to be installed in an app as follows:

  ```tsx
  export default app.createRoot(
    <>
      <AlertDisplay transientTimeoutMs={2500} />
      <OAuthRequestDialog />
      <SignalsDisplay />
      <AppRouter>
        <VisitListener />
        <Root>{routes}</Root>
      </AppRouter>
    </>,
  );
  ```

  With this in place you can remove the explicit installation via the `plugins` option for `createApp`.
