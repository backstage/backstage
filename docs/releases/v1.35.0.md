These are the release notes for the v1.35.0 release of [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).

A huge thanks to the whole team of maintainers and contributors as well as the amazing Backstage Community for the hard work in getting this release developed and done.

## Highlights

### **BREAKING**: Reduced support for the old backend system

The following packages have dropped support for the old backend system:

- `@backstage/plugin-signals-backend`
- `@backstage/plugin-search-backend-module-catalog`

See the [migration guide](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/building-backends/migrating) for details on how to migrate your backend to use the current backend system.

### GitHub organization ingestion reliability

The GitHub org entity provider will now handle both primary and secondary GitHub rate limits, pausing work when rate limits are encountered. This particularly improves reliability when ingesting large GitHub organizations. Contributed by [@sonikro](https://github.com/sonikro) in [#28085](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/28085)

### Task ID in scaffolder templates

The current task ID is now available in templates via `${{ context.task.id }}`, and in actions `ctx.task.id`. Contributed by [@fabiovincenzi](https://github.com/fabiovincenzi) in [#27592](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/27592)

### Fixed `yarn dev` command when only a single CPU core is reported

Users have been reporting issues with the `yarn dev` command not properly running the `app` and `backend` packages concurrently, instead starting them one after another. This turned out to be an issue on single-core machines where `yarn workspaces foreach` defaults to running one process at a time. This is fixed by adding the `--jobs unlimited` option to the command.

### Removed experimental Vite support

The `EXPERIMENTAL_VITE` flag is no longer supported by the Backstage CLI. If you were using it to improve bundling performance, we recommend switching to `EXPERIMENTAL_RSPACK` instead.

### Proxy endpoint extensions

The proxy plugin now has a new `proxyEndpointsExtensionPoint` that lets you programmatically configure proxy endpoints. Contributed by [@mbenson](https://github.com/mbenson) in [#27257](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/27257)

### Backend config schema workaround

Configuration schema from the `@backstage/backend-common` package will now be ignored if `@backstage/backend-defaults` is present, as it was causing conflicts in the backend configuration schema.

### Plugin backend error middleware

The error handler middleware has been added to the default `HttpRouterService`, this is in addition to the existing error handler middleware for the `RootHttpRouterService`. This change moves error reporting to be done within the context of a plugin, providing additional metadata. If you were using the `MiddlewareFactory` to add your own error handler middleware to the plugin router, this can be removed.

### Improved catalog `/entities` endpoint concurrency

When using the `catalog.disableRelationsCompatibility` flag to enable query streaming mode of the `/entities` endpoint, the endpoint will now fetch the next batch of entities without waiting for the current batch to be written to the response.
