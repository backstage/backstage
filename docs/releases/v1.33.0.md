These are the release notes for the v1.33.0 release of [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).

A huge thanks to the whole team of maintainers and contributors as well as the amazing Backstage Community for the hard work in getting this release developed and done.

## Highlights

### Catalog performance improvements and breadcrumbs

Some database improvements and fixes have been made to the catalog. The `refresh_state` table is no longer needed in the read path, and some indices have been dropped. We don't expect this to have any negative impact on end users; rather, performance should increase due to reduced index churn and less used storage.

Entity pages now also by default have a breadcrumb control in the page header, showing the context of the current entity such as what system and domain it’s in, if any.

### App backend config injection with read-only filesystem

The `app-backend` now stores the templated `index.html` file in memory rather than writing it to disk. This means you no longer need to use the `app.disableConfigInjection` flag when running with a read-only filesystem, allowing you to take advantage of the config injection.

### **BREAKING**: `LEGACY_BACKEND_START` has been removed

The CLI no longer supports the `LEGACY_BACKEND_START` flag, which means that old dev endpoints in `src/run.ts` have to be migrated to the new `dev/index.ts` structure instead.

### Scaffolder now supports Node.js v22

The `isolated-vm` dependency has been upgraded to `v5`, which means the scaffolder now supports Node.js v22. It also means that running Scaffolder with Node.js v16 is no longer possible.

### Scaffolder permissions and actions

A new `scaffolder.template.management` permission has been added. This permission is useful if you want to limit access to the frontend template management features. Contributed by [@stephenglass](https://github.com/stephenglass) in [#26946](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/26946)

A new `fs:readdir` action has been added. This action is useful if you need to retrieve the contents of a specific directory within a workspace. Contributed by [@secustor](https://github.com/secustor) in [#27283](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/27283)

### Catalog service ref for backends

The `@backstage/plugin-catalog-node` package now has a `catalogServiceRef` that backends should move to depending on for their catalog communication needs. If you are currently instantiating a `CatalogService` by hand, you will enjoy using this new service instead. The most important improvement is that it supports a credentials argument directly which gives it support for proper auth toward the catalog without having to make tokens with the `auth` core service.

### New generate-patch cli command

We have added a new `generate-patch` CLI command that can be used to generate patches for current changes in a source workspace, which can then be installed in a target workspace. This allows you to easily and immediately use changes that have been contributed upstream, without needing to wait for a release.

### Google LDAP support

Added support for Google LDAP to `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-ldap`. Contributed by [@megatroom](https://github.com/megatroom) in [#27373](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/27373)

### **BREAKING** AWS ALB authentication

The AWS ALB `fullProfile` will no longer have its username or email converted to lowercase. This is to ensure unique handling of the users. You may need to update and configure a custom sign-in resolver or profile transform as a result via `@backstage/plugin-auth-backend-module-aws-alb-provider`.

## Security Fixes

The kubernetes plugin received a bump of the `@kubernetes/client-node` dependency to mitigate CVEs related to the `request` and `tough-cookie` packages. Contributed by [@coreydaley](https://github.com/coreydaley) in [#25385](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/25385)
