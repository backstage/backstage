These are the release notes for the v1.36.0 release of [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).

A huge thanks to the whole team of maintainers and contributors as well as the amazing Backstage Community for the hard work in getting this release developed and done.

## Highlights

### BREAKING: Support for native ESM in Node.js code

The tooling in the Backstage CLI now supports native ESM in Node.js code. A highlight of this is that you can now import ESM-only packages using a dynamic `import(...)` from CommonJS code. This is a breaking change because dynamic imports were previously transformed to `require()` calls. A quick fix is to replace any existing `import(...)` calls with `require(...) as typeof import(...)`.

Support for ESM has been implemented in a way that maximizes compatibility with both existing code and code that’s bundled for browser environments. It keeps the existing module resolution logic intact, but adds support for explicit imports of files with the `.mts` and `.cts` extensions as well as their JavaScript counterparts.

You can read more about the new ESM support in the [build system documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/tooling/cli/build-system#ecmascript-modules).

### Welcome Canon

We have released the first version of [Canon](https://canon.backstage.io/), a new UI Library designed for Backstage. Canon is based on [Base UI](https://mui.com/base-ui/getting-started/) from MUI and is built to provide a better base and allow for greater flexibility in theming, but to be more restrictive in the styling of individual components. Canon is still in an early stage of development and it should not yet be used by plugins other than for experimentation. If you want to know more and join the discussion, we encourage you to head over to the [original RFC](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/27726).

### New Auditor service

A new auditor service is now available to plugin authors for recording critical actions and events within Backstage. The auditor service has been integrated with catalog and scaffolder.

### `yarn new`: bring your own template

The `new` command is now powered by a new template system that allows you to define your own templates in a declarative way, as well as import existing templates from external sources. See the [CLI templates documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/tooling/cli/templates) for more information on how to configure the templates used in your project and how to define your own.

As part of this change the template configuration is moving to the root `package.json`, and we have therefore deprecated the following options for the `new` command:

- `--license=<license>`: Configure the global `license` instead.
- `--no-private`: Configure the global `private` instead.
- `--baseVersion=<version>`: Configure the global `version` instead.
- `--npmRegistry=<url>`: Configure the global `publishRegistry` instead.
- `--scope=<scope>`: Configure the global `namePrefix` and/or `namePluginInfix` instead.

Some of the prompts for the built-in templates have also changed. The following backwards compatibility mappings for the `--select` and `--option` flags are enabled when using the default set of templates, but are marked as deprecated and will be removed in the future:

- `--select=plugin` is mapped to `--select=frontend-plugin`
- `--option=id=<id>` is mapped to `--option=pluginId=<id>`

### Make it easier to pass custom rules

We improved how plugins integrate with the permission framework, by introducing a new `PermissionRegistryService` as a replacement for the `createPermissionIntegrationRouter` middleware. This can be used to add additional permissions, rules, and resource types without the need to introduce extension points.
As a result, the `catalogPermissionExtensionPoint` has been deprecated in favour of the new `PermissionsRegistryService`.

### `UrlReadersService` improvements

In all the URL readers the `search` method has been updated to use the `readUrl` if the given URL doesn’t contain a pattern. For `UrlReader`s that didn't implement the `search` method, `readUrl` is now called internally and throws an error if the given URL doesn't contain a pattern.
As a result, the `UrlReaderProcessor` accepts a new config flag `catalog.useUrlReadersSearch` to always call the `search` method of `UrlReader`s. This flag currently defaults to `false`, but adopters are encouraged to enable it as this behavior will be the default in a future release.

### Scaffolder GitHub autocompletion

We’ve added support for autocompletion for GitHub repositories and branches built into the `RepoUrlPicker` and `RepoBranchPicker`. This can be enabled by installing the `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-github` and configuring the [GitHub Auth Provider](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/github/provider/).

### Configurable session duration for Auth providers

Added `auth.providers.<providerId>.sessionDuration` config for auth providers to allow the lifespan of user sessions to be configured. Contributed by [@JessicaJHee](https://github.com/JessicaJHee) in [#27821](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/27821)

### Experimental Graceful Shutdown for Scaffolder Workers

Introduced a new `scaffolder.EXPERIMENTAL_gracefulShutdown` flag in the scaffolder config to make the scaffolder block the shutdown process until all running tasks have completed. This is useful when there is a need to ensure that all tasks have completed before the scaffolder is shut down.

Please give this a try and let us know if it works for you!

### New Kubernetes permissions

Added `kubernetesResourcesReadPermission` and `kubernetesClustersReadPermission` to the kubernetes plugins. Use these permissions to restrict access to kubernetes clusters and resources.
