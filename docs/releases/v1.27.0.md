These are the release notes for the v1.27.0 release of [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).

A huge thanks to the whole team of maintainers and contributors as well as the amazing Backstage Community for the hard work in getting this release developed and done.

## Highlights

### Backend System Deprecations

As part of the [work towards a stable 1.0 release of the new backend system](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/24493), we will deprecate and move or remove several utilities from `@backstage/backend-common`. This release contains a few of these deprecations, with more to be expected in the future. The long-term goal is to completely deprecate and remove the `@backstage/backend-common` package.

### Hierarchical Domains

The Backstage System Model has been tweaked with the addition of a hierarchy of `Domain` entities. The change includes a new `spec.subdomainOf` property on the `Domain` entity, which can be used to express that a domain has a `partOf` (and conversely, `hasPart`) relation toward another domain.

### Scaffolder workspace serialization

Added experimental support for serialization of workspaces in the scaffolder. By serializing the workspace, it is possible to re-run the task in a non-sticky way. This means that the task can be restored and retried on a different scaffolder task worker.

To enable this feature, set the `EXPERIMENTAL_workspaceSerialization` option to `true` in the `scaffolder` section of the `app-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
scaffolder:
  EXPERIMENTAL_workspaceSerialization: true
```

### Scaffolder `notification:send` action

The new `notification:send` action allows sending notifications from templates. This can be used to send notifications to users when executing a template. Please note that the notifications system is still under development.

To install this action, add the new module to your backend:

```diff
+ backend.add(import('@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-notifications'));
```

### Backend Authentication

The requirement to configure a secret for backend authentication in production has been removed. It is now only needed if you rely on the [legacy authentication mechanism](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/service-to-service-auth#external-callers-legacy). If you don’t configure any secrets you will also not be able to generate tokens with the `TokenManager` service, although use of this service is discouraged as it has been replaced by the `AuthService`.

### User Authentication

The `auth` backend plugin now provides an `authOwnershipResolutionExtensionPoint` that lets you override the default ownership resolution used by sign-in resolvers. This allows you to customize this logic for all sign-in resolvers without replacing them.

### Events support for GitLab Entity and Org Discovery

The `GitlabDiscoveryEntityProvider` and `GitlabOrgDiscoveryEntityProvider` can now be configured to receive events from GitLab. This allows for the automatic discovery of entities in Backstage when groups or users are created or updated in GitLab.
