# Release v1.46.0

Upgrade Helper: [https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper/?to=1.46.0](https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper/?to=1.46.0)

## @backstage/plugin-techdocs-addons-test-utils@2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8d6709e: **BREAKING**: `TechDocsAddonTester.renderWithEffects()` no longer returns a screen; this means that you can no longer grab assertions such as `getByText` from its return value.

  Newer versions of `@testing-library` recommends using the `screen` export for assertions - and removing this from the addon tester contract allows us to more freely iterate on which underlying version of the testing library is being used.

  One notable effect of this, however, is that the `@testing-library` `screen` does NOT support assertions on the shadow DOM, which techdocs relies on. You will therefore want to add a dependency on [the `shadow-dom-testing-library` package](https://github.com/konnorrogers/shadow-dom-testing-library/) in your tests, and using its `screen` and its dedicated `*Shadow*` methods. As an example, if you keep doing `getByText` you will not get matches inside the shadow DOM - switch to `getByShadowText` instead.

  ```ts
  import { screen } from 'shadow-dom-testing-library';

  // ... render the addon ...
  await TechDocsAddonTester.buildAddonsInTechDocs([<AnAddon />])
    .withDom(<body>TEST_CONTENT</body>)
    .renderWithEffects();

  expect(screen.getByShadowText('TEST_CONTENT')).toBeInTheDocument();
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/core-app-api@1.19.3
  - @backstage/plugin-techdocs@1.16.1
  - @backstage/plugin-catalog@1.32.1
  - @backstage/plugin-catalog-react@1.21.4

  - @backstage/plugin-techdocs-react@1.3.6

## @backstage/backend-app-api@1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 5a2d538: Introduced backend startup result tracking and error handling. The `Backend.start()` method now returns a `BackendStartupResult` with detailed success/failure status and timing information for all plugins and modules. When startup fails, a `BackendStartupError` is thrown that includes the complete startup results, making it easier to diagnose which plugins or modules failed.

  This also improves the default error message when backend startup fails, and of course makes it possible to craft your own custom error reporting based on the startup results.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/backend-plugin-api@1.6.0

## @backstage/backend-defaults@0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- fa43826: Move `better-sqlite3` from dependencies to peer dependencies
- 2bc4e02: **BREAKING** The correct configuration options for Valkey are now being used.

  These changes are **required** to `app-config.yaml`:

  ```diff
  backend:
    cache:
      store: valkey
      connection: ...
      client:
  -     namespace: 'my-app'
  -     keyPrefixSeparator: ':'
  +     keyPrefix: 'my-app:'
  -     clearBatchSize: 1000
  -     useUnlink: false
  ```

  In comparison to Redis, Valkey requires the full `keyPrefix` including the separator to be specified instead of separate `namespace` and `keyPrefixSeparator` options. Also, Valkey does not support the `clearBatchSize` and `useUnlink` options.

### Patch Changes

- 37fba1d: Added support for Bitbucket Cloud OAuth. This introduces an alternative authentication method using a workspace OAuth consumer, alongside App Passwords (deprecated) and API tokens. OAuth does not require a bot or service account and avoids token expiry issues.

  **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - **@backstage/integration** (`src/bitbucketCloud/core.ts`)

    - `getBitbucketCloudRequestOptions` now returns a `Promise` and **must** be awaited.

  - **@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-bitbucket-cloud** (`src/actions/helpers.ts`)
    - `getBitbucketClient` now returns a `Promise` and **must** be awaited.
    - `getAuthorizationHeader` now returns a `Promise` and **must** be awaited.

  **OAuth usage example**

  ```yaml
  integrations:
    bitbucketCloud:
      - clientId: client-id
        clientSecret: client-secret
  ```

- de96a60: chore(deps): bump `express` from 4.21.2 to 4.22.0

- aa79251: build(deps): bump `node-forge` from 1.3.1 to 1.3.2

- f96edff: Allow configuration of the `referrerPolicy`

- fb029b6: Updated luxon types

- d9759a1: **BREAKING ALPHA**: The old `instanceMetadataService` has been removed from alpha. Please switch over to using the stable `coreServices.rootInstanceMetadata` and related types instead, available from `@backstage/backend-plugin-api`.

- 847a330: Fix for `jose` types

- 25b560e: Internal change to support new versions of the `logform` library

- 2a0c4b0: Adds a new experimental `RootSystemMetadataService` for tracking the collection of Backstage instances that may be deployed at any one time. It currently offers a single API, `getInstalledPlugins` that returns a list of installed plugins based on config you have set up in `discovery.endpoints` as well as the plugins installed on the instance you're calling the API with. It does not handle wildcard values or fallback values. The intention is for this plugin to provide plugin authors with a simple interface to fetch a trustworthy list of all installed plugins.

- 3016a79: Updated dependency `@types/archiver` to `^7.0.0`.

- 42db6a6: Don't warn when parsing `storeOptions` for `memory` cache

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/plugin-auth-node@0.6.10
  - @backstage/plugin-permission-node@0.10.7
  - @backstage/cli-common@0.1.16

## @backstage/cli@0.35.0

### Minor Changes

- f6f22a9: Provide `--no-node-snapshot` by default when running the `package start` or `package test`. You can disable this behavior by providing `NODE_OPTIONS='--node-snapshot'`.

- f8dff94: Switched the default module resolution to `bundler` and the `module` setting to `ES2020`.

  You may need to bump some dependencies as part of this change and fix imports in code. The most common source of this is that type checking will now consider the `exports` field in `package.json` when resolving imports. This in turn can break older versions of packages that had incompatible `exports` fields. Generally these issues will have already been fixed in the upstream packages.

  You might be tempted to use `--skipLibCheck` to hide issues due to this change, but it will weaken the type safety of your project. If you run into a large number of issues and want to keep the old behavior, you can reset the `moduleResolution` and `module` settings your own `tsconfig.json` file to `node` and `ESNext` respectively. But keep in mind that the `node` option will be removed in future versions of TypeScript.

  A future version of Backstage will make these new settings mandatory, as we move to rely on the `exports` field for type resolution in packages, rather than the `typesVersions` field.

- cd0b8a1: **BREAKING**: `jest` is now a peer dependency. If you run tests using Backstage CLI, you must add Jest and its environment dependencies as `devDependencies` in your project.

  You can choose to install either Jest 29 or Jest 30. The built-in Jest version before this change was Jest 29, however, we recommend that you switch to Jest 30. Upgrading will solve the `Could not parse CSS stylesheet` errors, allow you to use MSW v2 in web packages, and ensure that you remain compatible with future versions of the Backstage CLI. Support for Jest 29 is temporary, with the purpose of allowing you to upgrade at your own pace, but it will eventually be removed.

  - **Jest 29**: Install `jest@^29` and `jest-environment-jsdom@^29`. No migration needed, but you may see `Could not parse CSS stylesheet` warnings/errors when testing components from `@backstage/ui` or other packages using CSS `@layer` declarations.
  - **Jest 30**: Install `jest@^30`, `@jest/environment-jsdom-abstract@^30`, and `jsdom@^27`. Fixes the stylesheet parsing warnings/errors, but requires migration steps.

  See the [Jest 30 migration guide](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/jest30-migration) for detailed migration instructions.

### Patch Changes

- de96a60: chore(deps): bump `express` from 4.21.2 to 4.22.0

- e7db290: Add missing peer/dev dependencies to the frontend plugin template.

  `react-dom` was not declared as a peer dependency, causing module resolution
  errors when generating plugins outside a Backstage monorepo. This adds
  `react-dom` to `peerDependencies` (for consuming apps) and `devDependencies`
  (for local development). `react-router-dom` is also added to `peerDependencies` (for consuming apps) and `devDependencies`
  to support routing during plugin development.

  Fixes:

  - Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-dom'
  - Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-router-dom'

- 1226647: Updated dependency `esbuild` to `^0.27.0`.

- f89a074: Updated dependency `@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin` to `^0.6.0`.

- 2b81751: Updated dependency `webpack` to `~5.103.0`.

- fafd9e1: Fixed internal usage of `yargs`.

- c8c2329: Add proxy configuration from env-vars to create-app tasks

- 2bae83a: Switched compilation target to ES2022 in order to match the new set of supported Node.js versions, which are 22 and 24.

  The TypeScript compilation target has been set to ES2022, because setting it to a higher target will break projects on older TypeScript versions. If you use a newer TypeScript version in your own project, you can bump `compilerOptions.target` to ES2023 or ES2024 in your own `tsconfig.json` file.

- 7fbac5c: Updated to use new utilities from `@backstage/cli-common`.

- 2bae83a: Bumped dev dependencies `@types/node`

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/cli-node@0.2.16
  - @backstage/integration@1.19.0
  - @backstage/cli-common@0.1.16
  - @backstage/config-loader@1.10.7

## @backstage/integration@1.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 37fba1d: Added support for Bitbucket Cloud OAuth. This introduces an alternative authentication method using a workspace OAuth consumer, alongside App Passwords (deprecated) and API tokens. OAuth does not require a bot or service account and avoids token expiry issues.

  **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - **@backstage/integration** (`src/bitbucketCloud/core.ts`)

    - `getBitbucketCloudRequestOptions` now returns a `Promise` and **must** be awaited.

  - **@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-bitbucket-cloud** (`src/actions/helpers.ts`)
    - `getBitbucketClient` now returns a `Promise` and **must** be awaited.
    - `getAuthorizationHeader` now returns a `Promise` and **must** be awaited.

  **OAuth usage example**

  ```yaml
  integrations:
    bitbucketCloud:
      - clientId: client-id
        clientSecret: client-secret
  ```

### Patch Changes

- a26a322: Added support for using a GitHub App installation to generate tokens for public repository access when the `publicAccess` option is enabled. When all other authentication methods fail (e.g., the app is not installed in that organization), the provider will now use an available installation to generate a token that can be used to access public repositories as read only.
- fb029b6: Updated luxon types
- e15fdae: Made the github urls case insensitive.

## @backstage/ui@0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 16543fa: **Breaking change** The `Cell` component has been refactored to be a generic wrapper component that accepts `children` for custom cell content. The text-specific functionality (previously part of `Cell`) has been moved to a new `CellText` component.

  ### Migration Guide

  If you were using `Cell` with text-specific props (`title`, `description`, `leadingIcon`, `href`), you need to update your code to use `CellText` instead:

  **Before:**

  ```tsx
  <Cell
    title="My Title"
    description="My description"
    leadingIcon={<Icon />}
    href="/path"
  />
  ```

  **After:**

  ```tsx
  <CellText
    title="My Title"
    description="My description"
    leadingIcon={<Icon />}
    href="/path"
  />
  ```

  For custom cell content, use the new generic `Cell` component:

  ```tsx
  <Cell>{/* Your custom content */}</Cell>
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 50b7927: Fixed Checkbox indicator showing checkmark color when unchecked.

  Affected components: Checkbox

- 5bacf55: Fixed `ButtonIcon` incorrectly applying `className` to inner elements instead of only the root element.

  Affected components: ButtonIcon

- b3ad928: Fixed Table Row component to correctly handle cases where no `href` is provided, preventing unnecessary router provider wrapping and fixing the cursor incorrectly showing as a pointer despite the element not being a link.

  Affected components: Row

- a20d317: Added row selection support with visual state styling for hover, selected, and pressed states. Fixed checkbox rendering to only show for multi-select toggle mode.

  Affected components: Table, TableHeader, Row, Column

- fe7c751: Fixed `useTable` hook to prioritize `providedRowCount` over data length for accurate row count in server-side pagination scenarios.

- c145031: Fixed Table column sorting indicator to show up arrow when no sort is active, correctly indicating that clicking will sort ascending.

  Affected components: Column

## @backstage/plugin-auth-backend-module-github-provider@0.4.0

- b3286d5: Added the `github.com/user-id` annotation to store GitHub's user ID (immutable) in user entities. Also includes addition of the `userIdMatchingUserEntityAnnotation` sign-in resolver that matches users by the new ID.

### Patch Changes

- ed5a7a3: Introduce new configuration option to exclude suspended users from GitHub Enterprise instances.

  When it’s set to true, suspended users won’t be returned when querying the organization users for GitHub Enterprise instances.
  Note that this option should be used only against GitHub Enterprise instances, the property does not exist in the github.com GraphQL schema, setting it will cause a schema validation error and the syncing of users will fail.

- a413977: Added configurable `pageSizes` option to `GithubOrgEntityProvider` for GitHub GraphQL API queries to prevent `RESOURCE_LIMITS_EXCEEDED` errors with organizations with large number of teams and members. This aligns the configuration options with `GithubMultiOrgEntityProvider`.

- 2c74ea9: Added `KafkaPublishingEventConsumer` to support sending Backstage events to Kafka topics.

  This addition enables Backstage to publish events to external Kafka systems, complementing the existing ability to receive events from Kafka. This allows for better integration with external systems that rely on Kafka for event streaming.

## @backstage/core-components@0.18.4

### Patch Changes

- 9a942a4: Fixed bug in the `LogViewer` component where shift + click always opened a new window instead of just changing the selection.

  In addition, improved the `LogViewer` component by a few usability enhancements:

## @backstage/core-plugin-api@1.12.1

### Patch Changes

- 358c6f7: The `useApp` and `useRouteRef` functions are now forwards compatible with the new frontend system. Along with the previous route reference changes this means that there is no longer a need to use `compatWrapper` from `@backstage/core-compat-api` to make code based on `@backstage/core-plugin-api` compatible with `@backstage/frontend-plugin-api` APIs.
- 97cd16f: Reversed the relationship between the old `@backstage/core-plugin-api` and the new `@backstage/frontend-plugin-api`. Previously, the a lot of API definitions and utilities where defined in the old and re-exported from the old, but this change flips that around so that they now reside in the new package and are re-exported from the old. The external API of both packages remain the same, but this is a step towards being able to add further compatibility with the new frontend system built into the old.

## @backstage/frontend-plugin-api@0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- 75683ed: Added a new `errorPresentation` prop to `ExtensionBoundary` to control how errors are presented to the user. The default is `'error-display'`, which is the current behavior of showing the error in the `ErrorDisplay` component. The new option is `'error-api'`, posts errors to the `ErrorApi` and does not allow retries.

  The `AppRootElementBlueprint` now wraps its element in an `ErrorBoundary` using the new `'error-api'` presentation mode.

- 0bc1ce9: Fixed a versioning conflict that could result in a `.withContext` is not a function error.

- f3f84f1: Made the return type of `.withOverrides` to be simplified.

- 97cd16f: Reversed the relationship between the old `@backstage/core-plugin-api` and the new `@backstage/frontend-plugin-api`. Previously, the a lot of API definitions and utilities where defined in the old and re-exported from the old, but this change flips that around so that they now reside in the new package and are re-exported from the old. The external API of both packages remain the same, but this is a step towards being able to add further compatibility with the new frontend system built into the old.

  - Updates modelGeneric.mustache templates in both client and server generators
  - Updates modelTaggedUnion.mustache templates in both client and server generators
  - Uses {{baseName}} when available, falls back to {{name}} for backward compatibility
  - Maintains backward compatibility - no changes when propertyNaming=original is not used

## @backstage/plugin-bitbucket-cloud-common@0.3.5

### Patch Changes

- 37fba1d: Added support for Bitbucket Cloud OAuth. This introduces an alternative authentication method using a workspace OAuth consumer, alongside App Passwords (deprecated) and API tokens. OAuth does not require a bot or service account and avoids token expiry issues.

  **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - **@backstage/integration** (`src/bitbucketCloud/core.ts`)

    - `getBitbucketCloudRequestOptions` now returns a `Promise` and **must** be awaited.

  - **@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-bitbucket-cloud** (`src/actions/helpers.ts`)
    - `getBitbucketClient` now returns a `Promise` and **must** be awaited.
    - `getAuthorizationHeader` now returns a `Promise` and **must** be awaited.

  **OAuth usage example**

  ```yaml
  integrations:
    bitbucketCloud:
      - clientId: client-id
        clientSecret: client-secret
  ```

- Updated dependencies

### Patch Changes

- ed5a7a3: Introduce new configuration option to exclude suspended users from GitHub Enterprise instances.

  When it’s set to true, suspended users won’t be returned when querying the organization users for GitHub Enterprise instances.
  Note that this option should be used only against GitHub Enterprise instances, the property does not exist in the github.com GraphQL schema, setting it will cause a schema validation error and the syncing of users will fail.

## @backstage/plugin-notifications-backend-module-email@0.3.17

### Patch Changes

- a5d5b3a: SES config for the notification email processor now supports utilizing an ARN for the SES identity when sending an email after the SES SDK V2 update.

  The `sesConfig.fromArn` will set the `fromEmailAddressIdentityArn` option for the SES `SendEmailCommand`. The `sesConfig.sourceArn` field is removed since no equivalent option is available in the send email command options. Setting `sesConfig.sourceArn` will have no effect and log a warning. Example changes:

  ```diff
  notifications:
    processors:
      email:
        transportConfig:
          transport: "ses"
          region: "us-west-2"
        sender: "sender@mycompany.com"
        replyTo: "no-reply@mycompany.com"
        sesConfig:
  -       sourceArn: "arn:aws:ses:us-west-2:123456789012:identity/example.com"
          fromArn: "arn:aws:ses:us-west-2:123456789012:identity/example.com"
  ```
