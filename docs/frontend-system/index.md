## Status

The new frontend system is in alpha, and only a few plugins support the system so far. We do not yet recommend migrating any apps to the new system. If you add support for the new system to your plugin, please do so under a `/alpha` sub-path export.

You can find an example app setup in the [`app-next` package](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/packages/app-next).
