Our goal is to provide engineers with the best developer experience in the
world.

A fantastic developer experience leads to happy, creative and productive
engineers. Our belief is that engineers should not have to be experts in various
infrastructure tools to be productive. Infrastructure should be abstracted away
so that you can return to building and scaling, quickly and safely.

We are working on making Backstage the trusted standard toolbox (read: UX layer)
for the open source infrastructure landscape. Think of it like Kubernetes for
developer experience. We realize this is an ambitious goal. We canâ€™t do it
alone. If this sounds interesting or you'd like to help us shape our product
vision, we'd love to talk. You can email us directly:
