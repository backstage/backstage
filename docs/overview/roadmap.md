# Project roadmap

We created Backstage about 4 years ago. While our internal version of Backstage
has had the benefit of time to mature and evolve, the first iteration of our
open source version is still nascent. We are envisioning three phases of the
project and we have already begun work on various aspects of these phases:

- 🐣 **Phase 1:** Extensible frontend platform (Done ✅) - You will be able to
  easily create a single consistent UI layer for your internal infrastructure
  and tools. A set of reusable
  [UX patterns and components](http://storybook.backstage.io) help ensure a
  consistent experience between tools.

- 🐢 **Phase 2:** Service Catalog
  ([alpha released](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/06/22/backstage-service-catalog-alpha)) -
  With a single catalog, Backstage makes it easy for a team to manage ten
  services — and makes it possible for your company to manage thousands of them.
  Developers can get a uniform overview of all their software and related
  resources, regardless of how and where they are running, as well as an easy
  way to onboard and manage those resources.

- 🐇 **Phase 3:** Ecosystem (later) - Everyone's infrastructure stack is
  different. By fostering a vibrant community of contributors we hope to provide
  an ecosystem of Open Source plugins/integrations that allows you to pick the
  tools that match your stack.

Check out our [Milestones](https://github.com/spotify/backstage/milestones) and
open [RFCs](https://github.com/spotify/backstage/labels/rfc) how they relate to
the three Phases outlined above.

Our vision for Backstage is for it to become the trusted standard toolbox (read:
UX layer) for the open source infrastructure landscape. Think of it like
Kubernetes for developer experience. We realize this is an ambitious goal. We
can’t do it alone. If this sounds interesting or you'd like to help us shape our
product vision, we'd love to talk. You can email me directly:
