## Terminology

Backstage is constructed out of three parts. We separate Backstage in this way
because we see three groups of contributors that work with Backstage in three
different ways.

- Core - Base functionality built by core developers in the open source project.
- App - The app is an instance of a Backstage app that is deployed and tweaked.
  The app ties together core functionality with additional plugins. The app is
  built and maintained by app developers, usually a productivity team within a
  company.
- Plugins - Additional functionality to make your Backstage app useful for your
  company. Plugins can be specific to a company or open sourced and reusable. At
  Spotify we have over 100 plugins built by over 50 different teams. It has been
  very powerful to get contributions from various infrastructure teams added
  into a single unified developer experience.

## Overview

The following diagram shows how Backstage might look when deployed inside a
company which uses the Tech Radar plugin, the Lighthouse plugin, the CircleCI
plugin and the software catalog.

There are 3 main components in this architecture:

1. The core Backstage UI
2. The UI plugins and their backing services
3. Databases

Running this architecture in a real environment typically involves
containerising the components. Various commands are provided for accomplishing
this.

## User Interface

The UI is a thin, client-side wrapper around a set of plugins. It provides some
core UI components and libraries for shared activities such as config
management. [[live demo](https://demo.backstage.io/catalog)]

![UI with different components highlighted](../assets/architecture-overview/core-vs-plugin-components-highlighted.png)

Each plugin typically makes itself available in the UI on a dedicated URL. For
example, the Lighthouse plugin is registered with the UI on `/lighthouse`.

The CircleCI plugin is available on `/circleci`.

## Plugins and plugin backends

Each plugin is a client side application which mounts itself on the UI. Plugins
are written in TypeScript or JavaScript. They each live in their own directory
in the `plugins` folder. For example, the source code for the catalog plugin
is available at
[plugins/catalog](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/catalog).

### Installing plugins

Plugins are typically installed as React components in your Backstage
application. For example,
[here](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/app/src/App.tsx)
is a file that imports many full-page plugins in the Backstage sample app.

An example of one of these plugin components is the `CatalogIndexPage`, which is
a full-page view that allows you to browse entities in the Backstage catalog. It
is installed in the app by importing it and adding it as an element like this:

```tsx
import { CatalogIndexPage } from '@backstage/plugin-catalog';

...

const routes = (
  <FlatRoutes>
    ...
    <Route path="/catalog" element={<CatalogIndexPage />} />
    ...
  </FlatRoutes>
);
```

Note that we use `"/catalog"` as our path to this plugin page, but we can choose
any route we want for the page, as long as it doesn't collide with the routes
that we choose for the other plugins in the app.

These components that are exported from plugins are referred to as "Plugin
Extension Components", or "Extension Components". They are regular React
components, but in addition to being able to be rendered by React, they also
contain various pieces of metadata that is used to wire together the entire app.
Extension components are created using `create*Extension` methods, which you can
read more about in the
[composability documentation](../plugins/composability.md).

As of this moment, there is no config based install procedure for plugins. Some
code changes are required.

### Plugin architecture

Architecturally, plugins can take three forms:

1. Standalone
2. Service backed
3. Third-party backed

#### Standalone plugins

Standalone plugins run entirely in the browser.
[The Tech Radar plugin](https://demo.backstage.io/tech-radar), for example,
simply renders hard-coded information. It doesn't make any API requests to other
services.

![tech radar plugin ui](../assets/architecture-overview/tech-radar-plugin.png)

The architecture of the Tech Radar installed into a Backstage app is very
simple.

![ui and tech radar plugin connected together](../assets/architecture-overview/tech-radar-plugin-architecture.png)

#### Service backed plugins

Service backed plugins make API requests to a service which is within the
purview of the organisation running Backstage.

The Lighthouse plugin, for example, makes requests to the
[lighthouse-audit-service](https://github.com/spotify/lighthouse-audit-service).
The `lighthouse-audit-service` is a microservice which runs a copy of Google's
[Lighthouse library](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/) and stores the
results in a PostgreSQL database.

Its architecture looks like this:

![lighthouse plugin backed to microservice and database](../assets/architecture-overview/lighthouse-plugin-architecture.png)

The software catalog in Backstage is another example of a service backed plugin.
It retrieves a list of services, or "entities", from the Backstage Backend
service and renders them in a table for the user.

### Third-party backed plugins

Third-party backed plugins are similar to service backed plugins. The main
difference is that the service which backs the plugin is hosted outside of the
ecosystem of the company hosting Backstage.

The CircleCI plugin is an example of a third-party backed plugin. CircleCI is a
SaaS service which can be used without any knowledge of Backstage. It has an API
which a Backstage plugin consumes to display content.

Requests going to CircleCI from the user's browser are passed through a proxy
service that Backstage provides. Without this, the requests would be blocked by
Cross Origin Resource Sharing policies which prevent a browser page served at
[https://example.com](https://example.com) from serving resources hosted at
https://circleci.com.

## Package Architecture

Backstage relies heavily on NPM packages, both for distribution of libraries,
and structuring of code within projects. While the way you structure your
Backstage project is up to you, there is a set of established patterns that we
encourage you to follow. These patterns can help set up a sound project
structure as well as provide familiarity between different Backstage projects.

The following diagram shows an overview of the package architecture of
Backstage. It takes the point of view of an individual plugin and all of the
packages that it may contain, indicated by the thicker border and italic text.
Surrounding the plugin are different package groups which are the different
possible interface points of the plugin. Note that not all library package lists
are complete as packages have been omitted for brevity.

![Package architecture](../assets/architecture-overview/package-architecture.drawio.svg)

### Overview

The arrows in the diagram above indicate a runtime dependency on the code of the
target package. This strict dependency graph only applies to runtime
`dependencies`, and there may be `devDependencies` that break the rules of this
table for the purpose of testing. While there are some arrows that show a
dependency on a collection of frontend, backend and isomorphic packages, those
still have to abide by important compatibility rules shown in the bottom left.

The `app` and `backend` packages are the entry points of a Backstage project.
The `app` package is the frontend application that brings together a collection
of frontend plugins and customizes them to fit an organization, while the
`backend` package is the backend service that powers the Backstage application.
Worth noting is that there can be more than one instance of each of these
packages within a project. Particularly the `backend` packages can benefit from
being split up into smaller deployment units that each serve their own purpose
with a smaller collection of plugins.

### Plugin Packages

A typical plugin consists of up to five packages, two frontend ones, two
backend, and one isomorphic package. All packages within the plugin must share a
common prefix, typically of the form `@<scope>/plugin-<plugin-id>`, but
alternatives like `backstage-plugin-<plugin-id>` or
`@<scope>/backstage-plugin-<plugin-id>` are also valid. Along with this prefix,
each of the packages have their own unique suffix that denotes their role. In
addition to these five plugin packages it's also possible for a plugin to have
additional frontend and backend modules that can be installed to enable optional
features. For a full list of suffixes and their roles, see the
[Plugin Package Structure ADR](../architecture-decisions/adr011-plugin-package-structure.md).

The `-react`, `-common`, and `-node` plugin packages together form the external
library of a plugin. The plugin library enables other plugins to build on top of
and extend a plugin, and likewise allows the plugin to depend on and extend
other plugins. Because of this, it is preferable that plugin library packages
allow duplicate installations of themselves, as you may end up with a mix of
versions being installed as dependencies of various plugins. It is also
forbidden for plugins to directly import non-library packages from other
plugins, all communication between plugins must be handled through libraries and
the application itself.

### Frontend Packages

The frontend packages are grouped into two main groups. The first one is
"Frontend App Core", which is the set of packages that are only used by the
`app` package itself. These packages help build up the core structure of the app
as well as provide a foundation for the plugin libraries to rely upon.

The second group is the rest of the shared packages, further divided into
"Frontend Plugin Core" and "Frontend Libraries". The core packages are
considered particularly stable and form the core of the frontend framework.
Their most important role is to form the boundary around each plugin and provide
a set of tools that helps you combine a collection of plugins into a running
application. The rest of the frontend packages are more traditional libraries
that serve as building blocks to create plugins.

### Backend Packages

The backend library packages do not currently share a similar plugin
architecture as the frontend packages. They are instead simply a collection of
building blocks and patterns that help you build backend services. This is
however likely to change in the future.

### Common Packages

The common packages are the packages effectively depended on by all other pages.
This is a much smaller set of packages but they are also very pervasive. Because
the common packages are isomorphic and must execute both in the frontend and
backend, they are never allowed to depend on any of the frontend or backend
packages.

The Backstage CLI is in a category of its own and is depended on by virtually
all other packages. It's not a library in itself though, and must always be a
development dependency only.

### Deciding where you place your code

It can sometimes be difficult to decide where to place your plugin code. For example
should it go directly in the `-backend` plugin package or in the `-node` package?
As a general guideline you should try to keep the exposure of your code as low
as possible. If it doesn't need to be public API, it's best to avoid. If you don't
need it to be used by other plugins, then keep it directly in the plugin packages.

Below is a chart to help you decide where to place your code.

![Package decision](../assets/architecture-overview/package-decision.drawio.svg)

## Databases

As we have seen, both the `lighthouse-audit-service` and `catalog-backend`
require a database to work with.

The Backstage backend and its built-in plugins are based on the
[Knex](http://knexjs.org/) library, and set up a separate logical database per
plugin. This gives great isolation and lets them perform migrations and evolve
separate from each other.

The Knex library supports a multitude of databases, but Backstage is at the time
of writing tested primarily against two of them: SQLite, which is mainly used as
an in-memory mock/test database, and PostgreSQL, which is the preferred
production database. Other databases such as the MySQL variants are reported to
work but
[aren't tested as fully](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/2460)
yet.

## Cache

The Backstage backend and its built-in plugins are also able to leverage cache
stores as a means of improving performance or reliability. Similar to how
databases are supported, plugins receive logically separated cache connections,
which are powered by [Keyv](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv) under the hood.

At this time of writing, Backstage can be configured to use one of three cache
stores: memory, which is mainly used for local testing, memcache or Redis,
which are cache stores better suited for production deployment. The right cache
store for your Backstage instance will depend on your own run-time constraints
and those required of the plugins you're running.

### Use memory for cache

```yaml
backend:
  cache:
    store: memory
```

### Use memcache for cache

```yaml
backend:
  cache:
    store: memcache
    connection: user:pass@cache.example.com:11211
```

### Use Redis for cache

```yaml
backend:
  cache:
    store: redis
    connection: redis://user:pass@cache.example.com:6379
```

Contributions supporting other cache stores are welcome!

## Containerization

The example Backstage architecture shown above would Dockerize into three
separate Docker images.

1. The frontend container
2. The backend container
3. The Lighthouse audit service container

![Boxes around the architecture to indicate how it is containerised](../assets/architecture-overview/containerised.png)

The backend container can be built by running the following command:

```bash
yarn run build
yarn run build-image
```

This will create a container called `example-backend`.

The lighthouse-audit-service container is already publicly available in Docker
Hub and can be downloaded and run with

```bash
docker run spotify/lighthouse-audit-service:latest
```
