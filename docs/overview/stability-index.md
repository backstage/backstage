description: An overview of the commitment to stability for different parts of the Backstage codebase.

## Overview

The purpose of the Backstage Stability Index is to communicate the stability of
various parts of the project. It is tracked using a scoring system where a
higher score indicates a higher level of stability and is a commitment to
smoother transitions between breaking changes. Importantly, the Stability Index
does not supersede [semver](https://semver.org/), meaning we will still adhere
to semver and only do breaking changes in minor releases as long as we are on
`0.x`.

Each package or section is assigned a stability score between 0 and 3, with each
point building on top of the previous one:

- **0** - Breaking changes are noted in the changelog, and documentation is
  updated.
- **1** - The changelog entry includes a clearly documented upgrade path,
  providing guidance for how to migrate previous usage patterns to the new
  version.
- **2** - Breaking changes always include a deprecation phase where both the old
  and the new APIs can be used in parallel. This deprecation must have been
  released for at least two weeks before the deprecated API is removed in a
  minor version bump.
- **3** - The time limit for the deprecation is 3 months instead of two days.

TL;DR:

- **0** - There's a changelog entry.
- **1** - There's a migration guide.
- **2** - 2 weeks of deprecation.
- **3** - 3 months of deprecation.
