:::note Note
Backstage plugins are primarily written using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [React](https://reactjs.org). Having an understanding of these technologies will be beneficial on your journey to customizing Backstage!
:::

## Summary

Backstage plugins customize the app for your needs. There is a
[plugin directory](https://backstage.io/plugins) with plugins for many common
infrastructure needs - CI/CD, monitoring, auditing, and more.

## Adding existing plugins to your app

The following steps assume that you have
[created a Backstage app](./index.md) and want to add an existing plugin
to it.

You can find many wonderful plugins out there for Backstage, for example through the [Community Plugins Repository](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins) and the [Backstage Plugin Directory](https://backstage.io/plugins).

Adding plugins to your Backstage app is generally a simple process, and ideally each plugin will come with its own documentation on how to install and configure it. In this example we will add the [Tech Radar plugin](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/tech-radar/plugins/tech-radar) to our Backstage app.

1. Add the plugin's npm package to the repo:

   ```bash title="From your Backstage root directory"
   yarn --cwd packages/app add @backstage-community/plugin-tech-radar
   ```

   Note the plugin is added to the `app` package, rather than the root
   `package.json`. Backstage Apps are set up as monorepos with
   [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/). Frontend UI Plugins are generally added to the `app` folder, while Backend Plugins are added to the `backend` folder. In the example above, the plugin is added to the `app` package because we are adding the frontend plugin.

2. Now, modify your app routes to include the Router component exported from the tech radar, for example:

   ```tsx title="packages/app/src/App.tsx"
   /* highlight-add-start */
   import { TechRadarPage } from '@backstage-community/plugin-tech-radar';
   /* highlight-add-end */

   const routes = (
     <FlatRoutes>
       /* highlight-add-start */
       <Route
         path="/tech-radar"
         element={<TechRadarPage width={1500} height={800} />}
       />
       /* highlight-add-end */
     </FlatRoutes>
   );
   ```

   This is just one example, and if you'd like to continue adding the Tech Radar plugin you can do so by going [here](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/tech-radar/plugins/tech-radar), keep in mind each Backstage instance may integrate content or
   cards to suit their needs on different pages, tabs, etc. In addition, while some
   plugins such as this example are designed to be used in a stand-alone fashion,
   others may be intended to annotate or support specific software catalog entities
   and would be added elsewhere in the app.

### Adding a plugin page to the Sidebar

In a standard Backstage app created with
[@backstage/create-app](./index.md), the sidebar is managed inside
`packages/app/src/components/Root/Root.tsx`. The file exports the entire
`Sidebar` element of your app, which you can extend with additional entries by
adding new `SidebarItem` elements.

For example, if you install the `api-docs` plugin, a matching `SidebarItem`
could be something like this:

```tsx title="packages/app/src/components/Root/Root.tsx"
// Import icon from Material UI
import ExtensionIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Extension';

// ... inside the AppSidebar component
<SidebarItem icon={ExtensionIcon} to="api-docs" text="APIs" />;
```

You can also use your own SVGs directly as icon components. Just make sure they
are sized according to the Material UI's
[SvgIcon](https://material-ui.com/api/svg-icon/) default of 24x24px, and set the
extension to `.icon.svg`. For example:

```tsx
import InternalToolIcon from './internal-tool.icon.svg';
```

On mobile devices the `Sidebar` is displayed at the bottom of the screen. For
customizing the experience you can group `SidebarItems` in a `SidebarGroup`
(Example 1) or create a `SidebarGroup` with a link (Example 2). All
`SidebarGroup`s are displayed in the bottom navigation with an icon.

```tsx
// Example 1
<SidebarGroup icon={<MenuIcon />} label="Menu">
  ...
  <SidebarItem icon={ExtensionIcon} to="api-docs" text="APIs" />
  ...
<SidebarGroup />
```

```tsx
// Example 2
<SidebarGroup label="Search" icon={<SearchIcon />} to="/search">
  ...
  <SidebarItem icon={ExtensionIcon} to="api-docs" text="APIs" />
  ...
<SidebarGroup />
```

If no `SidebarGroup` is provided a default menu will display the `Sidebar`
content.
