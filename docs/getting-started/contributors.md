description: Documentation on how to get set up for doing development on the Backstage repository
---

Our vision for Backstage is for it to become the trusted standard toolbox (read: UX layer) for the open source infrastructure landscape. Think of it like Kubernetes for developer experience. We realize this is an ambitious goal. We can’t do it alone.

Therefore we want to create a strong community of contributors -- all working together to create the kind of delightful experience that our developers deserve.

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given. ❤️

To get you started we've put together a [Contributors Guide in the Backstage GitHub repo](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) that has all the information you need.
