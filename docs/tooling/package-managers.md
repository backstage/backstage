title: Package Managers
description: Which package managers the Backstage CLI supports, how it detects them, and how a pnpm app differs from a Yarn app.
---

The Backstage CLI runs package manager commands and reads the lockfile of your project. It supports Yarn and pnpm. Yarn is the default, and the rest of the documentation uses Yarn commands. Where a page says `yarn <script>` for a script of your project, a pnpm project runs `pnpm <script>` instead. Commands that are specific to Yarn, such as `yarn workspace` and `yarn install --immutable`, have their own pnpm forms, see [Commands in pnpm projects](#commands-in-pnpm-projects).

:::caution[Experimental]
pnpm support is experimental. The CLI, the app template, and this page may change in ways that require manual updates to your project.
:::

## Supported package managers

- **Yarn** is the default. The app template ships Yarn 4. Every part of the CLI and the app template supports it.
- **pnpm 11.28 or a later 11.x release, and pnpm 12.7 or later** are supported on Linux and macOS. Older releases do not link workspace packages into the root `node_modules` under the `hoisted` node linker, which backend plugins in the workspace rely on to find their own files. Commands that run pnpm fail with an error that names the supported versions when they find another pnpm version. The end-to-end tests run on Linux with pnpm 11.28 and 12.7, each with both the `hoisted` and the `isolated` node linker. See [Node linkers](#node-linkers) and [Known gaps](#known-gaps).

## Workspace root and installation root

The CLI tells two directories apart:

- The **workspace root** is the closest parent directory that holds a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file, or whose `package.json` has a `workspaces` field. The lockfile, the package manager settings, and pnpm catalogs live here. pnpm ignores the `workspaces` field, so a directory with that field belongs to a pnpm workspace above it when the `packages` patterns of its `pnpm-workspace.yaml` match the directory or a directory inside it, and no negated pattern leaves it out. Otherwise it is a workspace of its own, for example a Yarn project below a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` that only holds settings.
- The **installation root** is the closest parent directory, up to the workspace root, whose `package.json` has a `workspaces` field, and otherwise the workspace root. This is the Backstage installation that commands such as `repo start`, `versions:bump`, `info`, and `new` work on. The `repo` commands, such as `repo test`, `repo lint`, and `repo build`, work on the packages that its `workspaces` field lists, and the default configuration files, such as `app-config.yaml`, are loaded from it. In a Yarn workspace it is always the workspace root.

When neither root is found, both are the working directory, so the configuration files are loaded from there, as before.

The `backstage.json` file, which records the Backstage version, is the closest one from the installation root up to the workspace root. Several installations in one workspace can share a `backstage.json` file at the workspace root, or each have their own.

In most projects all of these are in the same directory. In a large pnpm monorepo, a Backstage installation can live in a subdirectory of a workspace that holds other projects too. The design assumes one Backstage version per workspace. To set up an installation in a subdirectory:

1. Give the `package.json` of the installation a `workspaces` field with the package globs of the installation, as the root `package.json` of a Yarn app has. pnpm ignores the field, and the CLI uses it to find the installation.
1. List the installation directory and its packages in the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file of the workspace root. pnpm only installs the dependencies of the projects that the file lists, and the CLI loads its modules, such as `@backstage/cli-defaults`, from the dependencies of the installation `package.json`.

```json title="apps/backstage/package.json"
{
  "name": "backstage",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["packages/*", "plugins/*"],
  "devDependencies": {
    "@backstage/cli": "^0.36.0",
    "@backstage/cli-defaults": "^0.1.0"
  }
}
```

```yaml title="pnpm-workspace.yaml"
packages:
  - apps/backstage
  - apps/backstage/packages/*
  - apps/backstage/plugins/*
  - libs/*
```

Keep the two package lists in sync. A package that the `workspaces` field lists but `pnpm-workspace.yaml` does not is still part of the installation for the CLI, but pnpm does not install its dependencies.

## Detection

The CLI looks at the workspace root and picks the package manager in this order:

1. The `packageManager` field in the root `package.json`, when it names `yarn` or `pnpm`. Without that field, the `devEngines.packageManager` field. When it lists several package managers, the first supported one counts.
1. A `pnpm-lock.yaml` file: pnpm.
1. A `yarn.lock` file: Yarn.
1. A `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file: pnpm.
1. A `workspaces` field in the root `package.json`: Yarn.
1. Otherwise Yarn, with a warning.

The `packageManager` field comes first, so that a lockfile left behind by another package manager does not decide which one the CLI uses. This matters while migrating, when the old lockfile is still in the project. A workspace with both a `pnpm-lock.yaml` and a `yarn.lock` file gets a warning about the extra lockfile. When `packageManager` and `devEngines.packageManager` name different package managers, `packageManager` decides and the CLI warns.

A `packageManager` or `devEngines.packageManager` value other than `yarn` or `pnpm` does not select anything. The CLI warns that the field was ignored and continues with the rest of the list. If there is nothing else to go on, the command fails instead of writing a `yarn.lock` into a project that picked another package manager.

Detection only reads the workspace root. Warnings go to stderr, so the JSON output of commands such as `info --format json` stays parseable.

CLI modules get the same result from the experimental `detectPackageManager` function in `@backstage/cli-node/alpha`. The Yarn package manager module is the exception and works with Yarn only.

## Creating a pnpm app

Pass `--package-manager pnpm` to `@backstage/create-app`:

```shell
npx @backstage/create-app@latest --package-manager pnpm
```

When the command runs through pnpm, pnpm is selected without the option:

```shell
pnpm create @backstage/app
```

The prerequisite check verifies that pnpm 11.28 or a later 11.x release, or pnpm 12.7 or later, is installed. After the files are written, `create-app` runs `pnpm install` and `pnpm tsc`. Yarn apps get a seed `yarn.lock` with a few known-good dependency pins. pnpm apps do not, and any such pin goes into `overrides` in the template instead.

## What the pnpm template contains

A pnpm app has the same packages and scripts as a Yarn app. These files differ:

- `package.json` sets `packageManager` to pnpm. It has no `workspaces` field and no `resolutions` field. The `build:backend` and `build-image` scripts use `pnpm --filter backend` instead of `yarn workspace backend`. The root also depends on `@types/node`, `@types/react`, and `@types/webpack-env`, which `tsc` only finds in the root `node_modules`. The `hoisted` node linker puts them there anyway, the `isolated` one does not.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` lists the workspace packages and holds the pnpm settings described below.
- `.yarnrc.yml`, the `.yarn` directory, and `yarn.lock` are not created.
- `packages/backend/Dockerfile` installs pnpm with `npm install -g pnpm@<version>`, where the version matches the `packageManager` field. It copies `package.json`, `backstage.json`, and the skeleton archive, and installs with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prod`. The skeleton archive holds `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and any patch files, see [Commands in pnpm projects](#commands-in-pnpm-projects). The cache mount points at the pnpm store.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` sets up pnpm with `pnpm/action-setup` and installs with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
- `.gitignore` ignores `pnpm-debug.log*` instead of the Yarn files, and `.dockerignore` drops the `.yarn` entries.
- `.prettierignore` ignores `pnpm-lock.yaml`, so that `prettier:check` does not fail on the lockfile.

The template writes plain version ranges for the `@backstage/*` dependencies. You can move them to a catalog yourself, see [Version bumps](#version-bumps).

The `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file looks like this:

```yaml title="pnpm-workspace.yaml"
packages:
  - packages/*
  - plugins/*

nodeLinker: hoisted

minimumReleaseAge: 4320
minimumReleaseAgeExclude:
  - '@backstage/*'

overrides:
  '@yarnpkg/core': 4.9.1
  '@types/react': ^18
  '@types/react-dom': ^18

allowBuilds:
  '@scarf/scarf': false
  '@swc/core': true
  better-sqlite3: true
  # ...
```

What each setting does:

- `nodeLinker: hoisted` gives a flat `node_modules` layout, like the one Yarn produces with `nodeLinker: node-modules`. This is the layout that the plugin ecosystem is tested against. See [Node linkers](#node-linkers).
- `minimumReleaseAge: 4320` tells pnpm to only resolve dependency versions that have been published for at least three days, which limits exposure to compromised releases. `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` lifts the limit for `@backstage/*`, so `versions:bump` can move to a Backstage release on the day it is published. The Yarn template does the same with `npmMinimalAgeGate` and `npmPreapprovedPackages`. This turns the protection off for the packages that a Backstage app depends on most. If you would rather wait for those too, remove the exclusion, and `versions:bump` fails until a release is three days old.
- `overrides` holds the same pins as the `resolutions` field of the Yarn template. pnpm ignores `resolutions`, so the pins live here.
- `allowBuilds` controls which dependencies may run their install scripts. pnpm blocks all of them by default. The template allows the dependencies with native code that a default app needs, and turns off scripts that only print messages or collect telemetry.

The template keeps the pnpm default `autoInstallPeers: true`. When a package has a peer dependency that the version installed in the project does not satisfy, pnpm installs a second copy that does, next to that package. Yarn only warns about the unmet peer dependency and uses the installed version. A second copy of a package such as `@mui/material` can break styling or React context. To get the Yarn behavior under the `hoisted` node linker, set `autoInstallPeers: false` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and check the warnings that `pnpm install` prints. Under the `isolated` linker, an unmet peer dependency is then not available to the package at all.

### Adding a dependency with build scripts

When you add a dependency that runs a build script on install, `pnpm install` fails with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` and lists the packages that are not covered by `allowBuilds`. Add each listed package to `allowBuilds`. Use `true` when the script builds something the package needs, and `false` when it only prints a message. Then run `pnpm install` again:

```yaml title="pnpm-workspace.yaml"
allowBuilds:
  my-native-dependency: true
```

## Version bumps

`versions:bump` resolves the target version of every matching package once, and writes each version where the dependency is already declared:

- A plain range, such as `^1.2.0`, is updated in the `package.json` that declares it.
- A `catalog:` reference is updated in the default catalog of the root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- A `catalog:<name>` reference is left alone, unless you pass `--catalog <name>`.

With `--catalog <name>`, the command updates the entries of that catalog and nothing else. This is useful when you deliberately keep a second release line, such as a `backstage-next` catalog during a migration:

```shell
pnpm backstage-cli versions:bump --catalog backstage-next --release next
```

A catalog that does not exist is an error, so that a typo does not create a catalog that nothing refers to. The command checks this before it changes any files. A catalog belongs to the whole workspace, so bumping it also moves the packages outside of the Backstage installation that refer to it. `versions:bump` never moves a dependency between a range and a catalog, which keeps it compatible with lint rules that enforce catalog usage. It also leaves `backstage.json` alone when it bumps a named catalog. Only the versions in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` change, so its comments and formatting are kept.

`overrides` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` take precedence over both version ranges and catalogs. When overrides pin packages that `versions:bump` bumps, the command warns, since those packages keep the versions that the overrides set until you update or remove them.

`--dry-run` shows the bumps without changing any files. `--dry-run --json` prints the resolved versions as JSON on stdout, with all other output on stderr, so that tools such as Renovate or a build system can reuse the version resolution:

```shell
pnpm backstage-cli versions:bump --dry-run --json
```

The `backstage:^` version protocol needs the Backstage Yarn plugin and is not available with pnpm.

## Commands in pnpm projects

The CLI commands work the same in Yarn and pnpm projects. These are the differences:

- `versions:migrate` and `new` run `pnpm install` after they change `package.json` files. `new` runs the `lint --fix` script of the created package with pnpm.
- `new` writes `catalog:` for the dependencies of the created package that have an entry in the default catalog, so that it works in repositories that require catalogs, for example through the `pnpm/json-enforce-catalog` lint rule. Other dependencies get version ranges.
- `repo build`, `repo lint`, and `repo test` with `--since` diff `pnpm-lock.yaml` at the given git ref to find changed packages. The names of the workspace packages are read from the same ref. When the changed lockfile belongs to another package manager, or cannot be compared, all packages count as changed.
- `repo test` finds the packages that `pnpm-workspace.yaml` declares, or the packages that the `workspaces` field lists for an installation in a subdirectory.
- `package build` for backend packages and `build-workspace` copy `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, the patch files that its `patchedDependencies` setting names, and the pnpmfile into the dist workspace, so that `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` works there. The lockfile entries of bundled packages, such as the app, are emptied, since their dependencies are left out of the dist workspace. Packages that need a pack step, for example with `--alwaysPack`, are packed with `pnpm pack` and keep their `workspace:` and `catalog:` dependency ranges. The backend `skeleton.tar.gz` contains these files too. Only the pnpmfile itself is copied, so a pnpmfile that loads other local files fails the build. Move that code into the pnpmfile.
- `package bundle` makes the bundle a pnpm project of its own, and prunes and installs its lockfile offline. It copies the patch files, the pnpmfile, and the registry settings of the root `.npmrc` file into the bundle, but not auth settings or credentials in registry URLs. When the pnpm cache lacks a package, the command fails and names the package and the settings that decide where pnpm looks for it. See [package bundle](./cli/module-build.md#lockfile-and-installation).
- `info` prints a `pnpm:` line with the pnpm version. The JSON output has a `packageManager` object with `name` and `version`. The `yarn` field is only present in Yarn projects.
- `package start --link <path>` accepts a pnpm workspace as the linked workspace. See [Linking in Local Packages](./local-dev/linking-local-packages.md).
- Messages that tell you to run a command, such as `repo fix`, print the pnpm form of the command.

Two tools outside the CLI also follow the package manager:

- The fix of the `no-undeclared-imports` rule in `@backstage/eslint-plugin` uses `pnpm add` and `pnpm remove`. It picks pnpm from the `packageManager` or `devEngines.packageManager` field of the root `package.json`, or from a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file in the workspace root.
- The **Info** tab of the DevTools plugin reads `pnpm-lock.yaml` in pnpm projects. It lists packages installed from the registry. Packages in the workspace itself are not listed in pnpm projects.

## Running under a build system

pnpm workspaces are often driven by a build system that owns installs and caching. The CLI commands are safe to run in that setting:

- No command installs dependencies implicitly. `versions:bump` and `new` run an install only without `--skip-install`, and `package bundle` installs into its own output directory.
- The success caches of `repo test` and `repo lint` are opt-in.
- A readable lockfile is not required. Without one, `--since` counts every package as changed, `versions:bump` skips its report of possibly breaking updates, `info` leaves out installed packages, `repo test` and `repo lint` run without their success cache, and `package build` and `build-workspace` create the dist workspace without a lockfile.
- pnpm does not have to be on the `PATH` for commands that do not run it. The CLI checks the pnpm version the first time it runs pnpm, not when it detects the package manager, so commands that only read the project files, such as `repo test` and `repo lint`, work where pnpm is not available.
- Checking the pnpm version does not write files. pnpm records a pinned pnpm version in `pnpm-lock.yaml` on every command, so the CLI runs `pnpm --version` with the `lockfile` setting turned off.

## Node linkers

The CLI and the backend work with both the `hoisted` and the `isolated` node linker, as long as hoisting is not turned off. The template uses `hoisted`, since plugins with undeclared imports break under `isolated`, and an app must keep working with whatever plugins you install. Many pnpm monorepos run `isolated`, and you can switch to it once your plugins declare all of their imports. The `no-undeclared-imports` lint rule reports the imports that would break.

Two more things change under `isolated`:

- `tsc` only finds the types that the `tsconfig.json` of the CLI names, `@types/node` and `@types/webpack-env`, in the root `node_modules`. The template declares them, together with `@types/react`, in the root `package.json`. An app that was created before, or migrated from Yarn, needs to add them.
- The app shares a default set of dependencies with dynamic frontend plugins through module federation, among them `react`, `@material-ui/core`, `@material-ui/styles`, `@mui/material`, and `@emotion/react`. Under `isolated`, a dependency is only shared when the app can import it, which means the app package declares it. The build prints which shared dependencies it skips. Add the ones that your dynamic frontend plugins rely on to the dependencies of the app.

pnpm 11.28 and later 11.x releases, and pnpm 12.7 and later, link workspace packages into the root `node_modules` under `hoisted`, as Yarn does. Under `isolated` with the default `hoist: true`, every package is also linked into the hidden `node_modules/.pnpm/node_modules` directory.

If you set `hoistWorkspacePackages: false`, the backend no longer finds the app package that it serves. Add the app package to the `dependencies` of the root `package.json`, which links it into the root `node_modules`. Use `dependencies` rather than `devDependencies`, so that production installs keep it.

## Known gaps

- Layouts where a package can only see its own dependencies are not supported: `hoist: false`, and the global virtual store when the backend is started with plain `node` rather than through `pnpm`. `resolvePackagePath` from `@backstage/backend-plugin-api` cannot find other packages in these layouts, so backend plugins that locate their own files with it, such as their database migrations, fail to start. Keep hoisting enabled for the backend packages, or start the backend through `pnpm` when you use the global virtual store.
- Windows is not supported for pnpm projects.
- The `backstage:^` version protocol needs the Backstage Yarn plugin.
- These `@backstage/repo-tools` commands resolve binaries from the root `node_modules/.bin` or run `yarn`, and do not work in pnpm projects: `package-docs`, the OpenAPI schema commands, `api-reports`, and `type-deps`. `generate-patch` works with Yarn patches only.
- `pm verify-patches` from the Yarn package manager module works with Yarn only. `@backstage/cli-defaults` includes the module, so a pnpm app installs it too. The Yarn packages that the command needs, such as `@yarnpkg/core`, are optional peer dependencies of the module, which pnpm does not install.
- Only one Backstage version per workspace is supported, apart from a deliberate second release line in a named catalog.
- `create-app` cannot generate an app into an existing pnpm workspace yet.
- Only lockfile version 9 is supported, which pnpm 9 through 12 write.
- Catalogs are not supported in Yarn projects.
- The Backstage repository itself uses Yarn. Contributing to Backstage does not involve pnpm.

## Migrating an existing app from Yarn to pnpm

:::caution[Experimental]
Try the migration on a branch. These steps follow the differences between the Yarn and pnpm app templates, and do not cover changes you have made to your project.
:::

1. Update the app to a Backstage release with pnpm support while it still uses Yarn. If the app uses `backstage:^` versions, remove the Yarn plugin with `yarn plugin remove @yarnpkg/plugin-backstage` and run `yarn backstage-cli versions:bump`, so that every `package.json` has explicit version ranges.
1. Install pnpm 11.28 or a later 11.x release, or pnpm 12.7 or later.
1. Create `pnpm-workspace.yaml` in the project root with the settings shown in [What the pnpm template contains](#what-the-pnpm-template-contains). Copy the `packages` globs from the `workspaces` field of the root `package.json`.
1. In the root `package.json`, set `packageManager` to your pnpm version, for example `pnpm@12.14.0`, and remove the `workspaces` field.
1. Move the `resolutions` field of the root `package.json` to `overrides` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Entries with a range in the key do not mean the same thing. Yarn applies `"ms@npm:*": "2.0.0"` only to dependencies that are declared with the range `*`, while pnpm applies `'ms@*': 2.0.0` to every version of `ms`. To limit an override to the dependencies of one package, use the `parent>child` form, for example `'@types/http-proxy-middleware>http-proxy-middleware': ^3.0.7`.
1. Replace `yarn workspace backend` with `pnpm --filter backend` in the root `package.json` scripts, and check any other scripts that call `yarn`.
1. Optionally, run `pnpm import`. It creates `pnpm-lock.yaml` from `yarn.lock`, so that the first install keeps the versions that Yarn had locked instead of resolving every dependency again.
1. Delete `yarn.lock`, `.yarnrc.yml`, and the `.yarn` directory. Remove the Yarn entries from `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore`, and add `pnpm-debug.log*` to `.gitignore` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` to `.prettierignore`. If the project has Yarn patches in `.yarn/patches`, keep a copy and remove the `patch:` entries from `overrides`. Recreate each patch after the first `pnpm install`: run `pnpm patch <package>`, apply the changes in the directory it prints, and run `pnpm patch-commit <directory>` to write the patch file and the `patchedDependencies` entry.
1. Run `pnpm install`. When a dependency runs a build script that `allowBuilds` does not cover, the install fails with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` and lists the packages. Add each of them to `allowBuilds`, then run `pnpm install` again.
1. Update `packages/backend/Dockerfile`: install pnpm with `npm install -g pnpm@<version>`, remove the lines that copy the Yarn files, copy only `package.json` and the skeleton archive before the install, since the skeleton holds `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and any patch files, and replace `yarn workspaces focus --all --production` with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prod`. Change the cache mount of the install step to the pnpm store, `/home/node/.local/share/pnpm/store`. See [Host Build with pnpm](../deployment/docker.md#host-build-with-pnpm).
1. Update your CI workflow to set up pnpm and run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` instead of `yarn install --immutable`. Replace every remaining `yarn` command in the workflow with `pnpm`, and remove the corepack and Yarn cache steps. Add a `pnpm/action-setup` step before `actions/setup-node`, and set `cache: pnpm` on `actions/setup-node`.
1. Run `pnpm tsc`, `pnpm build:all`, and `pnpm test` to verify the project.
