title: Build Module
description: CLI commands for building, starting, and packaging Backstage packages.
---

The build module (`@backstage/cli-module-build`) handles building, starting,
and packaging Backstage packages, both individually and across the repo.

For details on the build system itself, see the
[Build System](./02-build-system.md) documentation.

## repo start

Start a set of packages in the project for local development. If no explicit
packages are listed via arguments or options, packages will instead be selected
based on their [package role](./02-build-system.md#package-roles). If a single
set of frontend and/or backend packages are found, they will be started. If
there are multiple matches the directories `packages/app` and
`packages/backend` will be preferred. If no matches are found the command will
fall back to expecting a single plugin frontend and/or backend package to start
instead.

Any `--config` options in the `start` script in `package.json` of the selected
packages will be picked up and used, unless a `--config` option is provided to
this command, in which case it will be used instead.

Any `--require` option in the `start` script in `package.json` of the selected
backend package will be picked up and used.

## package bundle

:::caution[Experimental]
This command is experimental and may receive breaking changes in future releases
without a deprecation period. It is hidden from the main `--help` output.
:::

Bundle a plugin for dynamic loading. This creates a self-contained plugin
package that can be deployed independently and loaded dynamically by a Backstage
application. Supports both backend and frontend plugins, in Yarn and pnpm
projects.

Unlike regular builds, the bundle command:

- Creates a fully self-contained plugin deliverable

- Produces module federation assets (frontend) or includes plugin dependencies
  in the plugin's private `node_modules`, building and packing (with the
  pack command of the package manager) the local `workspace:^` dependencies
  first (backend).
- Generates a config schema from plugin-related packages only.
- Validates that the plugin exports valid dynamic loading entry points (backend
  only)

### Usage

```bash
# Bundle the current package (output: ./bundle/)
yarn backstage-cli package bundle

# Bundle to a specific directory (output: ../dynamic-plugins/<mangled-package-name>/)
yarn backstage-cli package bundle --output-destination ../dynamic-plugins

# Override the bundle subdirectory name
yarn backstage-cli package bundle --output-name my-plugin-bundle

# Clean output before bundling
yarn backstage-cli package bundle --clean

# Skip building for the plugin and its local dependencies
yarn backstage-cli package bundle --no-build

# Skip dependency installation and entrypoint validation
yarn backstage-cli package bundle --no-install

# Stream detailed output from build, pack, and install steps
yarn backstage-cli package bundle --verbose

# Use a pre-built dist workspace for batch bundling.
# First, create the workspace with:
#   backstage-cli build-workspace <output-dir> [packages...] --alwaysPack
# Then pass <output-dir> as --pre-packed-dir:
yarn backstage-cli package bundle --pre-packed-dir ../dist-workspace
```

### Options

```text
Usage: backstage-cli package bundle [options]

Bundle a plugin for dynamic loading

Options:
  --output-destination <dir>  Directory in which the bundle subdirectory is created.
                              Defaults to the current package directory.
  --output-name <name>        Name of the bundle subdirectory. Defaults to "bundle" when
                              output stays in the package directory, or to the mangled
                              package name (e.g. myorg-plugin-foo) when
                              --output-destination is specified.
  --clean                     Clean the output directory before bundling
  --no-build                  Skip building packages (assumes they are already built)
  --no-install                Skip dependency installation and entrypoint validation.
  --verbose                   Stream detailed output from internal steps (build, pack,
                              install) to the console. Without this flag, output is
                              captured to per-step log files and only shown on error.
  --pre-packed-dir <dir>      Path to a pre-built dist workspace (from
                              build-workspace --alwaysPack). Skips local dependency
                              packing and uses pre-packed packages directly. For frontend
                              plugins, this also enables lockfile generation for SBOM.
```

### Lockfile and installation

The bundle is a project of its own. The command seeds its lockfile from the plugin directory when a lockfile exists there, and from the monorepo root otherwise. It then prunes the lockfile down to what the bundle needs and, for backend plugins, installs the private `node_modules` from it. The prune step runs offline against the cache of the package manager, which the install in the source project has already filled. In pnpm projects the install step runs offline as well.

In Yarn projects, the bundle gets a `.yarnrc.yml` and a `yarn.lock`. The `resolutions` of the root `package.json` are merged into the bundle `package.json`.

In pnpm projects, the bundle gets a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. The workspace file sets `nodeLinker: hoisted` and carries the `overrides` of the root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, since pnpm ignores the `resolutions` field. It also copies two groups of settings from the root workspace file:

- `storeDir`, `cacheDir`, `registry`, `registries`, `namedRegistries`, `minimumReleaseAge`, `minimumReleaseAgeExclude`, `resolutionMode`, and `allowBuilds`, so that the offline steps read the same store and metadata cache as the source project, and native dependencies are built the same way.
- `packageExtensions`, `patchedDependencies`, `pnpmfile`, `peerDependencyRules`, `ignoredOptionalDependencies`, `supportedArchitectures`, `autoInstallPeers`, `excludeLinksFromLockfile`, `dedupePeerDependents`, `catalog`, and `catalogs`, which change what the lockfile resolves to.

The patch files and the pnpmfile are copied into the bundle. Files from outside of the workspace root are renamed when their names collide. A missing patch file fails the command, since the bundle would otherwise ship the package unpatched. Only the pnpmfile itself is copied, so a pnpmfile that loads other local files fails the command. Move that code into the pnpmfile. The packages that the pnpmfile loads must be installed in a parent directory of the bundle, since the bundle has no `node_modules` when pnpm first loads the pnpmfile. Write the bundle inside the project for that, or remove the import. The registry settings of the root `.npmrc` file are copied into a `.npmrc` file of the bundle, since pnpm keeps its metadata cache per registry. Auth settings and credentials in registry URLs are not copied, from the `.npmrc` file or from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

Other settings of the root workspace file that could affect the result are named in a warning. When the root `package.json` pins a pnpm version in `packageManager`, the bundle `package.json` gets the same pin, so that the bundle uses that pnpm version even when it is written outside the source project.

Offline steps stay offline. When the pnpm cache lacks the metadata or the tarball of a package, the command fails and names the package and the settings that decide where pnpm looks for it, rather than reaching for the network.

### Output contract

The bundle output is a directory that can be deployed as a standalone unit.
Consumers of the bundle (such as `@backstage/backend-dynamic-feature-service`
or `@backstage/frontend-dynamic-feature-loader`) can rely on the following
guarantees:

**All bundles:**

- A `package.json` at the bundle root with entry points configured for dynamic
  loading. The `backstage.role` and `files` fields are preserved from the source
  package.
- A `dist/` directory containing the built plugin code.
- A `dist/.config-schema.json` file (when any config schemas apply) containing
  gathered schemas from the plugin, its local workspace dependencies, and
  third-party dependencies. Schemas from unrelated Backstage packages are
  excluded.
- No `scripts` or `devDependencies` in `package.json`.

**Backend plugins** (`backend-plugin`, `backend-plugin-module`):

- A `node_modules/` directory with all production dependencies (including local
  workspace dependencies), pinned to their exact versions from the source
  lockfile.
- `bundleDependencies` is set to `true` in `package.json`.

**Frontend plugins** (`frontend-plugin`, `frontend-plugin-module`):

- `main` points to `dist/remoteEntry.js` (the Module Federation remote entry).
- `types` points to `dist/@mf-types/index.d.ts` when type declarations are
  available.
- No embedded `node_modules/` directory.

### Environment variables

The bundle command supports the same environment variables as the Backstage yarn
plugin for resolving `backstage:^` version specifiers:

- `BACKSTAGE_MANIFEST_FILE`: Path to a local manifest file (for offline usage)
- `BACKSTAGE_VERSIONS_BASE_URL`: Custom base URL for fetching release manifests

### Supported package roles

The bundle command supports packages with the following roles:

- `backend-plugin`
- `backend-plugin-module`
- `frontend-plugin`
- `frontend-plugin-module`

## package clean

Remove cache directories.

```text
Usage: backstage-cli package clean [options]

Delete cache directories
```

## package prepack

This command should be added as `scripts.prepack` in all packages. It enables
packaging- and publish-time overrides for fields inside `package.json`. For
more details, see the build system
[publishing](./02-build-system.md#publishing) section.

```text
Usage: backstage-cli package prepack [options]

Prepares a package for packaging before publishing
```

## package postpack

This should be added as `scripts.postpack` in all packages. It restores
`package.json` to what it looked like before calling the `prepack` command.

```text
Usage: backstage-cli package postpack [options]

Restores the changes made by the prepack command
```

## build-workspace

Builds a mirror of the workspace using the packaged production version of each
package. This essentially calls the pack command of the package manager, such as
`yarn pack`, in each included package and unpacks the resulting archive in the
target `workspace-dir`.

```text
Usage: backstage-cli build-workspace [options] <workspace-dir> [packages...]

Options:
  --alwaysPack  Force workspace output to be a result of running the pack
                command of the package manager on each package (warning: very
                slow)
```

When `--alwaysPack` is used, the output directory can be passed to
`backstage-cli package bundle --pre-packed-dir` to speed up batch bundling of
multiple plugins from the same monorepo.
