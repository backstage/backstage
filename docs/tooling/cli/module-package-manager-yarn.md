title: Yarn Package Manager Module
description: CLI command for verifying Yarn patch references.
---

The Yarn package manager module (`@backstage/cli-module-package-manager-yarn`)
verifies that Yarn patch
references, local patch files, and `yarn.lock` remain aligned. When a project
patches a Backstage package, it also checks that the package version matches
the Backstage release selected in `backstage.json`.

See [Generating temporary patches](../local-dev/linking-local-packages.md#generating-temporary-patches)
for guidance on creating Yarn patches for locally modified Backstage packages.

The command verifies Yarn's native `patch:` protocol, available in Yarn 2 and
later. It does not inspect patches managed by tools such as `patch-package` in
Yarn Classic repositories.

## pm verify-patches

Run this command from the root of a Yarn repository:

```shell
yarn backstage-cli pm verify-patches
```

The command scans the root and workspace `package.json` files for `patch:`
references in `resolutions`, `dependencies`, `devDependencies`,
`optionalDependencies`, and `peerDependencies`. It reports all of the
following problems together before exiting unsuccessfully:

- Missing or orphaned local patch files.
- Patch references that do not agree with `yarn.lock`.
- Patched `@backstage/*` packages that are missing from, or do not match, the
  selected Backstage release.

By default, the command is read-only: it does not run Yarn, install
dependencies, or write project files. Use it alongside `yarn install
--immutable`; immutable installs protect the resolved dependency state, while
this command verifies that patch declarations and the selected Backstage
release remain aligned.

If a release upgrade leaves project-owned Backstage patches pinned to old
package versions, use `--fix` to attempt a conservative repair:

```shell
yarn backstage-cli pm verify-patches --fix
```

The fix is limited to exact-version `@backstage/*` patches in the root
`resolutions`. The command updates all eligible outdated patches to the
versions in the selected Backstage release and runs one lockfile-only Yarn install. It
never downgrades a patched package, and it rejects unrelated lockfile changes.
Afterward it runs the normal verification over the result. Dependency build
scripts are disabled during the install, which uses the repository's
configured Yarn binary, plugins, and registry settings.

The repair operates directly in the working checkout. If the install or final
verification fails, it restores `package.json` and `yarn.lock`. Run it in a
clean, exclusive checkout because an abrupt process or machine interruption
can leave a partial change behind. If a declaration is ambiguous or a patch no
longer applies cleanly, the command exits with the original verification
failure for manual repair.

An automated Backstage version bump can run these commands in order:

```shell
yarn backstage-cli versions:bump
yarn backstage-cli pm verify-patches --fix
yarn backstage-cli pm verify-patches
```

For offline or mirrored environments, set `BACKSTAGE_MANIFEST_FILE` to a local
release manifest or `BACKSTAGE_VERSIONS_BASE_URL` to the base URL from which
release manifests are fetched.
