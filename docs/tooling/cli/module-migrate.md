description: CLI commands for version management and package migrations.
---

The migrate module (`@backstage/cli-module-migrate`) bumps Backstage package
versions, migrates moved packages, and runs package migration utilities.

## versions\:bump

Bump all `@backstage` packages to the latest versions. This checks for updates
in the package registry and updates `package.json` files when necessary. See
more about how this command can be configured and used
[for keeping Backstage updated](../../getting-started/keeping-backstage-updated.md).

```text
Usage: backstage-cli versions:bump [options]

Options:
  -h, --help        display help for command
  --pattern <glob>  Override glob for matching packages to upgrade
  --release <version|next|main> Bump to a specific Backstage release line or version (default: "main")
  --skip-install    Skips the install step
  --skip-migrate    Skips migration of any moved packages
  --catalog <name>  Only bump the entries of this pnpm catalog, instead of version ranges and the default catalog
  --dry-run         Show the version bumps without changing any files
  --json            Print the resolved versions as JSON, only together with --dry-run
```

Each new version is written where the dependency is declared. A version range is updated in the `package.json` file that declares it. In pnpm workspaces, a `catalog:` reference is updated in the default catalog of `pnpm-workspace.yaml` instead. References to named catalogs are left alone, unless the catalog is passed with `--catalog`, in which case only that catalog is updated. This is useful when you deliberately keep a second release line, such as a `backstage-next` catalog during a migration:

```bash
backstage-cli versions:bump --catalog backstage-next --release next
```

A catalog belongs to the whole pnpm workspace, so bumping it also moves every other package in the workspace that refers to it, including packages outside of the Backstage installation that you run the command in. If a package refers to a catalog that `pnpm-workspace.yaml` doesn't define, the command fails before it changes any files.

`--dry-run --json` prints the resolved version of each package as JSON and changes no files, which lets other tools reuse the version resolution.

In pnpm workspaces, `overrides` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` take precedence over both version ranges and catalogs. The command warns about overrides that pin the packages it bumps, since those packages keep the versions from the overrides until you update or remove them.

## versions\:migrate

Migrate any plugins that have been moved to the `@backstage-community`
namespace. This command scans all packages in the project for dependencies that
have a `backstage.moved` field in their `package.json`, updates the dependency
names in `package.json` files, and optionally rewrites import paths in source
files.

In pnpm workspaces, a dependency that refers to a catalog keeps its `catalog:` reference, and the new package name gets an entry with the same version in that catalog, unless the catalog already has one. When the catalog has no entry for either name, the dependency is left as it is, with a warning.

After making changes the command installs dependencies with the package manager of the project, such as `yarn install`, to update the lockfile.

```text
Usage: backstage-cli versions:migrate [options]

Options:
  --pattern <glob>       Override glob for matching packages to upgrade
  --skip-code-changes    Skip code changes and only update package.json files
  -h, --help             display help for command
```

## migrate package-roles

Add the `backstage.role` field to packages that do not already have it. This
field identifies the purpose of each package and is used by other CLI commands
to determine the correct build and lint behavior.

```text
Usage: backstage-cli migrate package-roles

Add package role field to packages that don't have it
```

## migrate package-scripts

Set package scripts according to each package's role. This ensures that all
packages have the correct `build`, `test`, `lint`, `prepack`, and `postpack`
scripts for their role.

```text
Usage: backstage-cli migrate package-scripts

Set package scripts according to each package role
```

## migrate package-exports

Synchronize package subpath export definitions. This updates the `exports` field
in `package.json` to match the expected structure for each package role.

```text
Usage: backstage-cli migrate package-exports

Synchronize package subpath export definitions
```

## migrate package-lint-configs

Migrate all packages to use the ESLint configuration factory provided by the
CLI. This replaces custom ESLint configurations with
`@backstage/cli/config/eslint-factory`.

```text
Usage: backstage-cli migrate package-lint-configs

Migrates all packages to use @backstage/cli/config/eslint-factory
```

## migrate react-router-deps

Migrate the `react-router` dependencies for all packages to be peer
dependencies. This is part of the migration to support newer versions of React
Router.

```text
Usage: backstage-cli migrate react-router-deps

Migrates the react-router dependencies for all packages to be peer dependencies
```
