description: How to get started with the notifications and signals
---

The Backstage Notifications System provides a way for plugins and external services to send notifications to Backstage users.
These notifications are displayed in the dedicated page of the Backstage frontend UI or by frontend plugins per specific scenarios.
Additionally, notifications can be sent to external channels (like email) via "processors" implemented within plugins.

Notifications can be optionally integrated with the signals (a push mechanism) to ensure users receive them immediately.

### Upgrade to the latest version of Backstage

To ensure your version of Backstage has all the latest notifications and signals related functionality, it’s important to upgrade to the latest version. The [Backstage upgrade helper](https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper/) is a great tool to help ensure that you’ve made all the necessary changes during the upgrade!

## About notifications

Notifications are messages sent to either individual users or groups.
They are not intended for inter-process communication of any kind.

There are two basic types of notifications:

- **Broadcast**: Messages sent to all users of Backstage.
- **Entity**: Messages delivered to specific listed entities, such as Users or Groups.

Example of use-cases:

- System-wide announcements or alerts
- Notifications for component owners: e.g., build failures, successful deployments, new vulnerabilities
- Notifications for individuals: e.g., updates you have subscribed to, new required training courses
- Notifications pertaining to a particular entity in the catalog: A notification might apply to an entity and the owning team.

## Installation

The following sections will walk you through the installation of the various parts of the Backstage Notification System.

### Add Notifications Backend

First we need to add the backend package:

```bash title="From your Backstage root directory"
yarn --cwd packages/backend add @backstage/plugin-notifications-backend
```

Then we need to add it to our backend:

```ts title="packages/backend/src/index.ts"
const backend = createBackend();
// ...
backend.add(import('@backstage/plugin-notifications-backend'));
```

### Add Notifications Frontend

First we need to add the frontend package:

```bash title="From your Backstage root directory"
yarn --cwd packages/app add @backstage/plugin-notifications
```

To add the notifications main menu, add the following:

```tsx title="packages/app/src/components/Root/Root.tsx"
import { NotificationsSidebarItem } from '@backstage/plugin-notifications';

<SidebarPage>
  <Sidebar>
    <SidebarGroup>
      // ...
      <NotificationsSidebarItem />
    </SidebarGroup>
  </Sidebar>
</SidebarPage>;
```

Also add the route to notifications:

```tsx title="packages/app/src/App.tsx"
import { NotificationsPage } from '@backstage/plugin-notifications';

<FlatRoutes>
  // ...
  <Route path="/notifications" element={<NotificationsPage />} />
</FlatRoutes>;
```

### Optional: Add Signals

The use of signals is optional but improves user experience.

#### Optional: Add Signals Backend

Add Signals to your backend by first adding the backend package:

```bash title="From your Backstage root directory"
yarn --cwd packages/backend add @backstage/plugin-signals-backend
```

The add the signals to your backend:

```ts title="packages/backend/src/index.ts"
const backend = createBackend();
// ...
backend.add(import('@backstage/plugin-signals-backend'));
```

#### Optional: Signals Frontend

Start with adding the frontend package:

```bash title="From your Backstage root directory"
yarn --cwd packages/app add @backstage/plugin-signals
```

To install the plugin, add the `SignalsDisplay` to your app root:

```tsx title="packages/app/src/App.tsx"
import { SignalsDisplay } from '@backstage/plugin-signals';

export default app.createRoot(
  <>
    <AlertDisplay transientTimeoutMs={2500} />
    <OAuthRequestDialog />
    {/* highlight-add-next-line */}
    <SignalsDisplay />
    <AppRouter>
      <VisitListener />
      <Root>{routes}</Root>
    </AppRouter>
  </>,
);
```

If the signals plugin is properly configured, it will be automatically discovered by the notifications plugin and used.

### User-specific notification settings

The notifications plugin provides a way for users to manage their notification settings. To enable this, you must
add the `UserNotificationSettingsCard` to your frontend.

```tsx title="packages/app/src/App.tsx"
<Route path="/settings" element={<UserSettingsPage />}>
  <SettingsLayout.Route path="/advanced" title="Advanced">
    <AdvancedSettings />
  </SettingsLayout.Route>
  <SettingsLayout.Route path="/notifications" title="Notifications">
    <UserNotificationSettingsCard
      originNames={{ 'plugin:scaffolder': 'Scaffolder' }}
    />
  </SettingsLayout.Route>
</Route>
```

You can customize the origin names shown in the UI by passing an object where the keys are the origins and the values are the names you want to show in the UI.

Each notification processor will receive its own column in the settings page, where the user can enable or disable notifications from that processor.
