description: Core backend service APIs

The default backend provides several [core services](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/backend-plugin-api/src/services/definitions/coreServices.ts) out of the box which includes access to configuration, logging, URL Readers, databases and more.

All core services are available through the `coreServices` namespace in the `@backstage/backend-plugin-api` package:

```ts
import { coreServices } from '@backstage/backend-plugin-api';
```
