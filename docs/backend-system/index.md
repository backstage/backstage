## Status

The new backend system is in alpha, and only a small number of plugins have been migrated so far. It is possible to try it out, but it is not recommended to use this new system in production yet.

You can find an example backend setup in [the `backend-next` package](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/packages/backend-next).
