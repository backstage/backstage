title: 'Creating your first Backstage app'
---

### Prerequisites

None!

### What should I get out of this guide?

This guide is the first of 4 Golden Paths that will walk you through everything you need to start working with Backstage. We'll touch on how to get started and spin up a new app, how to write plugins, how to deploy your app to production and how to drive adoption for your new portal. Even if you're non-technical, you can skip forward to the `adoption` Golden Path and learn about how to help your team's new developer portal succeed.

### Structure

As mentioned above, this is the first of 4 Golden Paths - you should make sure this guide is 100% complete before continuing on to the other Golden Paths (`adoption` is the exception). We'll start by spinning up a new app for you, walking through what we just created and what you can do after you have a working app.
