Your plugin should have been generated by default for the New Frontend System which is config-first. That means you can easily control your frontend components through your `app-config.yaml`.

Let's try this quickly by disabling our entire TODO page,

```yaml
# TODO
```

We can also do really cool things like provide React props directly through config. Let's try moving our hard coded list of TODOs to config instead,

```tsx
// todo
```

and the config,

```yaml
# TODO
```

### Why does this work?

<!--TODO-->
