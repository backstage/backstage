## Integrations

Now that our plugin is ready for prime time, let's see how we can really leverage the rest of the Backstage ecosystem. Backstage provides a set of core features out of the box, namely, the Software Catalog, Search, Permissions, and Notifications.

### Catalog

We want to show our todos as separate Catalog entities. How can we make this happen?

### Search

We want to make our todos searchable.

### Permissions

We only want users to be able to find their own todos.

### Notifications

We want to set an alarm time for todos that sends a notification when the time is met.
