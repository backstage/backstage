## Why build plugins?

This section should answer definitely why you should build a new plugin. The Backstage framework is deeply empowered by plugins and plugins are core to the project's success. Users should walk away from reading this section with a conviction that plugins are the right path for new functionality.

## Sustainable plugin development

Plugins are not developed in a vacuum. Users should reach for them to solve specific business problems facing their developers, for example, you may be tasked to create

- a new vendor integration like PagerDuty,
- a new plugin backend that talks to an internal service,
- etc.

This section should contain learnings from successful Backstage deployments about how to engage with stakeholders, how/when to iterate on your plugin, and setting yourself up for future success.
