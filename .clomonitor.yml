exemptions:

    # Justification of this exemption (mandatory, it will be displayed on the UI)
    reason: 'The Linux Foundation trademark disclaimer and link are contained within the project web site at https://backstage.io in the copyright footer. However, because the site is delivered dynamically via React through JavaScript, the check cannot currently identify it.'
