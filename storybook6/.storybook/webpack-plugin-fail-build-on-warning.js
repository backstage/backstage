/**
 * When building storybook, we can have warnings which may cause issues in the future. One of the example case is
 * https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/718. To make sure new warnings are not introduced with new PRs, we
 * want to fail CI builds if there are warnings when building storybook.
 *
 * This webpack plugin makes sure the CI builds fail on Webpack warnings. We also have an allowlist of warnings here
 * which we think are non-critical.
 *
 * Note that this implementation will not detect other warnings emitted by storybook build that are separate from
 * Webpack. A better solution over this plugin should be preferred, possibly on Storybook level (CLI options etc.)
 *
 * The case with #718 is caused because we are using `ts-loader` for `webpack` to load all our JS/TS files, but we
 * have disabled type checking during build. This is done by setting `transpileOnly` to `true` in storybook/main.js
 * and it improves the Storybook build speed. Because of this, Webpack emits warnings when we try to re-export types.
 * Reference: https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader#transpileonly
