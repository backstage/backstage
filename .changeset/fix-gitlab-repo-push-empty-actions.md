Fixed `gitlab:repo:push` failing with `400 Bad request - Provide at least one action` when the workspace has no file changes to commit (e.g. re-running a template against an already up-to-date branch). The action now detects an empty action list, skips the commit API call, and logs a warning whenever `allowEmpty` is not true (covering both the default of unset and an explicit `false`). The `commitHash` output is omitted in this no-op case and is now declared optional. Pass `allowEmpty: true` to retain the previous behavior of forwarding an empty commit to GitLab.
