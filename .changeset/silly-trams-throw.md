Performance improvements:

The DependencyGraph used to have two relatively "slow" update debounces (250ms and 100ms). These have been lowered dramatically to 10ms (i.e. withing a rendering frame).

Improved performance of updates to nodes and edges from _O_(nÂ²) to _O_(n log(n)), and fixed edge updates to re-use existing edges, which removes the flickering/shaking of the UI when the graph updates.
