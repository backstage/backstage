'@backstage/core-components': patch

Migrated CopyTextButton component from Material-UI to Backstage UI (BUI). Replaced MUI IconButton and Tooltip with BUI ButtonIcon and TooltipTrigger/Tooltip components. This is an internal refactoring that maintains backward compatibility - the component API remains unchanged.
