'@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-github-org': patch
---

Added configurable `pageSizes` for GitHub GraphQL API queries to prevent `RESOURCE_LIMITS_EXCEEDED` errors with organizations with large number of teams and members. Please see the [GitHub Org Data documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/github/org#configuration-details) for new configuration options.
