**Breaking** We are upgrading our `Text` component to support all font sizes making the `Heading` component redundant. The new `Text` component introduces 4 sizes for title and 4 sizes for body text. All of these work in multiple colors and font weights. We improved the `as` prop to include all possible values. The `Link` component has also been updated to match the new `Text` component.
