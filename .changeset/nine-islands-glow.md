Added Toast component with React Aria integration. The Toast component displays brief, temporary notifications for actions, errors, or other events. It supports multiple status variants (info, success, warning, danger), flexible positioning, auto-dismiss with timeout, programmatic control, and deep stacking of multiple toasts. The component uses a global queue system for triggering toasts from anywhere in the application.
