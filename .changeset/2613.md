Initial implementation of catalog user lookup

This adds a basic catalog client + method for the Google provider to look up users in the catalog. It expects to find a single user entity in the catalog with a google.com/email annotation that matches the email of the Google profile.

Right now it falls back to the old behavior of splitting the email, since I don't wanna break the sign-in flow for existing apps, not yet anyway x).

- Added "@backstage/catalog-model@^0.1.1-alpha.23" as a dependency
- Added "node-fetch@^2.6.1" as a dependency
