'@backstage/plugin-auth-backend': patch

Marked the remaining exports related to `createRouter` and the old backend system as deprecated.

For more information about migrating to the new backend system, see the [migration guide](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/building-backends/migrating#the-auth-plugin).

Support for the old backend system will be removed in the next release of this plugin.
