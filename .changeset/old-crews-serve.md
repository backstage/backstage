**BREAKING** Removed support for the legacy backend, please [migrate to the new backend system](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/v1.38.0/plugins/catalog-backend-module-incremental-ingestion#installation). Also, if you were importing from the `/alpha` export of this package, you should remove the `/alpha` part.
