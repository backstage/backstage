'@backstage/cli-module-new': patch
---

The built-in `yarn new` templates have been moved to this package from `@backstage/cli`. The default template references have been updated from `@backstage/cli/templates/*` to `@backstage/cli-module-new/templates/*`. Existing references to `@backstage/cli/templates/*` in your root `package.json` will continue to work through a backwards compatibility rewrite.
