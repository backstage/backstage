Add missing translation entries for catalog UI text.

This change adds translation keys and updates relevant UI components to use the correct localized labels and text in the catalog plugin. It ensures that catalog screens such as entity layout, tabs, search result items, table labels, and other UI elements correctly reference the i18n system for translation.

No functional behavior is changed aside from the improved internationalization support.
