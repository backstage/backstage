'@backstage/backend-defaults': patch
---

The `connection` config option for the Redis cache store now accepts either a string URL or an object with additional connection options that are passed directly to the underlying client. The object form is only supported when `backend.cache.store` is `redis`; other stores require a plain string. This allows configuring options like `pingInterval` without needing dedicated config fields. For clustered Redis, the connection object properties are merged into cluster defaults. Fixes https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/31813, https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/31742.
