'@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-gitlab': patch
---

The `gitlab:projectVariable:create` action no longer includes the variable value in its checkpoint key, preventing secret values from being persisted in scaffolder task state. The `gitlab:pipeline:trigger` action has been refactored so that the temporary pipeline trigger token is never serialized into checkpoint state.
