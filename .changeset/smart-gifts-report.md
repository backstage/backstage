'@backstage/plugin-catalog-unprocessed-entities': patch
---

Show additional info on DevTools unprocessed entities table

- Location path (so that it's easier to search the failed entity from the YAML URL)
- Time info of last discovery and next refresh time so that users can be aware of it and can sort the errors based on the time.
