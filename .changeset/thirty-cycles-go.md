'@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-graph': minor
---

New catalog backend module for the `catalog-graph` frontend plugin (or other API usages).

When installed, a new endpoint `/api/catalog/graph` will be available which the `catalog-graph` will use to render faster, especially for high-latency users.
