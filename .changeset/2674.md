Auto-create plugin databases

Relates to #1598.

This creates databases for plugins before handing off control to plugins.

The list of plugins currently need to be hard-coded depending on the installed plugins. A later PR will properly refactor the code to provide a factory pattern where plugins specify what they need, and Knex instances will be provided based on the input.
