Added plugin and module templates for the new frontend system. These templates are not included by default, but can be included by adding `@backstage/cli/templates/new-frontend-plugin` and `@backstage/cli/templates/new-frontend-plugin-module` as [custom templates](https://backstage.io/docs/tooling/cli/templates#installing-custom-templates).
