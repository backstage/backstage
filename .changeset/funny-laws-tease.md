'@backstage/cli': patch
---

Updated the scaffolding output message for `plugin-common` in `backstage-cli`. Now, when executing `backstage-cli new` to create a new `plugin-common` package, the output message accurately reflects the action by displaying `Creating common plugin package...` instead of the previous, less accurate `Creating backend plugin...`.
