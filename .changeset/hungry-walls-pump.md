'@backstage/core-components': patch
---

Fixed a bug in the SidebarSubmenuItem within the core-components package that caused the dropdown button to be misaligned in the sidebar and the button text to appear in uppercase due to the default <Button> behavior. Also added an example dropdown menu to the app for reference.
