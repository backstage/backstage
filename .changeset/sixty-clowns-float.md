**BREAKING ALPHA**: The `defaultPath`, `defaultTitle`, and `defaultGroup` params of `PageBlueprint` has been renamed to `path`, `title`, and `group`. The `convertLegacyEntityContentExtension` utility has also received the same change. This change does not affect the compatibility of extensions created with older versions of this blueprint.
