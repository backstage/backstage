'@backstage/cli-module-ai': minor
---

Added a new CLI module for installing AI skills from your Backstage catalog. `backstage-cli ai resolve` shows which `AiResource` skills apply to the repository you are working in, based on its catalog system and owner and on your groups, and explains why each skill was or was not selected. `backstage-cli ai skills sync` installs those skills into your coding agents, such as Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor, using skills.sh, and requires Node.js 22.20 or later. Telemetry in skills.sh is disabled by default; set `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` yourself to change that. The module is not part of the default CLI modules; add `@backstage/cli-module-ai` to your root `package.json` to use it.
