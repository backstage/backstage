'@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-gcp': patch
---

Added new config path `scaffolder.taskRecovery.gcsBucket.name` for GCS workspace provider. The previous `EXPERIMENTAL_workspaceSerializationGcpBucketName` config is still supported as a fallback. Workspace upload failures are now propagated so that a task does not record a completed step without its corresponding workspace.
